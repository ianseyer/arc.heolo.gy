Michael Carbajal vs. Humberto Gonzalez I

The <a href="Michael%20Carbajal">Michael Carbajal</a> vs. <a href="Humberto%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Humberto González</a> I <a href="boxing">boxing</a> fight was an encounter that made history in many ways. While this pair of world junior flyweight champions fought three times, their first fight is the one that writers and fans usually remember with fondness. 
In boxing, there are certain types of "rivalries" that fans get excited about most of the time. When a <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rican</a> fighter faces a Mexican, for example, in a major title fight, most of the time the fight itself is considered a big boxing event. The same can be said about Mexicans fighting against a fellow Mexican for a world title. 
The Mexican versus Mexican-American rivalries also fall among boxing fans' favorite rivalries. A good example is the sustained rivalry between <a href="Bobby%20Chacon">Bobby Chacon</a>, from <a href="California">California</a>, and <a href="Rafael%20Lim%C3%B3n">Rafael Limón</a>, from Mexico. A more recent example is <a href="Oscar%20De%20La%20Hoya">Oscar De La Hoya</a> against <a href="Julio%20C%C3%A9sar%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Julio César Chávez</a>. 
When Michael Carbajal, from <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, became a professional boxer in 1989, Humberto González, from Mexico, was already a seasoned professional. Carbajal's promoter, <a href="Bob%20Arum">Bob Arum</a>, told <a href="Ring%20magazine">"Ring" magazine</a> that Carbajal would be the first junior flyweight to earn one million <a href="US%20dollar">dollars</a> for one fight. 
Carbajal won the <a href="International%20Boxing%20Federation">IBF</a> world junior flyweight title in 1990, joining <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a> world champion Gonzalez as co-champions of that division. After Carbajal won the title, fan excitement about a possible match between the two began to grow. But Gonzalez lost his title to <a href="Rolando%20Pascua">Rolando Pascua</a> on October of that year, and he had to regain it from <a href="Melchor%20Cob%20Castro">Melchor Cob Castro</a>, who took over as champion after beating Pascua.
Meanwhile, Carbajal had begun a streak of defenses against a number of important challengers. When Gonzalez regained his WBC belt, he also retained it against a long list of challengers. The fact that both boxers were seemingly on what boxing fans call a "clash course" brought another element of excitement whenever fans would talk about a future match between Carbajal and Gonzalez. 
Knowing that this was a well talked about match-up, promoter Arum began to work towards making it happen. In what could perhaps be called a rare case of boxing unity, both the WBC and IBF agreed to have their champions fight a unification bout. The date set was March 17, 1993. The fight received much media attention both in the United States and in Latin America, with Carbajal and Gonzalez being featured on the cover of multiple magazines on the months preceding the bout.
Arum proved half prophetic in his guess that Carbajal would be the first junior flyweight to earn one million dollars in a fight: Both Carbajal and Gonzalez got a guarantee of one million dollars, after they paid their due fees, and Carbajal-Gonzalez I became the first time in history that a fight fought at the Flyweight division or a smaller one garnered one boxer that amount of money. It was also the first time that a junior flyweight world title bout was shown as the main event of a <a href="Pay%20Per%20View">Pay Per View</a> fight card.
The fight took place on the date (March 17, 1993) that it was set for (unlike many major fights that sometimes get postponed). Carbajal and Gonzalez fought that night in front of an estimated number of about 20,000 fans in a <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> <a href="hotel">hotel</a> parking lot. Among the people watching the fight in person were many <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> stars, which is also very rare for a junior flyweight bout.
Gonzalez set the pace in round one with his jab and cross, stunning Carbajal as he (Gonzalez) counter-punched. Gonzalez proved very slick for Carbajal, who had trouble finding his rival, but nonetheless, fought back furiously. In round two, a Gonzalez right to Carbajal's chin sent the <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> native down for a short count. 
Carbajal started landing stronger punches by round three. But Gonzalez's ability to counter-punch Carbajal's attack seemed to be the factor that would dictate the fight. By the end of the round, Carbajal sported a cut over one of his eyes.
Gonzalez and Carbajal kept trading punches in round four, but it was apparent that Gonzalez was faring better than Carbajal. Carbajal's corner team had begun to grow impatient by this point. 
Gonzalez almost had Carbajal knocked out in round five. Ironically, that round might have been the round that turned the fight in Carbajal's favor. A straight right landed flush on Carbajal's chin, and Carbajal struggled to stay inside the fight's ring as he fell, grabbing to the rope with his left hand. Gonzalez was now eager to finish the fight by knockout, and Carbajal realized he was behind on points so badly, that he had to try to win by knockout as well.
Fighting with desperation, Carbajal finally got to Gonzalez, who by now was tired, in round six, connecting strong punches to the head and causing swelling around one of Gonzalez's eyes.
Still, Carbajal felt that he had to do more to win the bout. As both fighters were looking for a defining, knockout punch they traded punches in the seventh round, as they say in boxing, "toe to toe". During one of these exchanges, Carbajal unexpectedly landed a right uppercut to Gonzalez's chin, leaving him paralyzed on his feet. As Gonzalez did not move from his stand for the next couple of seconds, Carbajal took advantage and moved to the right, adding a left to Gonzalez's face that would make Gonzalez fall to the canvas on his back. The referee counted Gonzalez out, giving Carbajal the fight by a seventh round knockout.
Michael Carbajal defended the IBF and WBC world junior flyweight titles twice before his second fight with Gonzalez. The pair fought three fights, with Gonzalez winning the next two, one in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> and another one in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, but both of Gonzalez's wins came by decision and the two sequels to fight one between Carbajal and Gonzalez were considered to be boring fights by fans and writers alike.
Gonzalez retired after losing the IBF and WBC belts to <a href="Saman%20Sorjaturong">Saman Sorjaturong</a> in 1995. Carbajal, for his part, kept on winning, and losing, world titles until his last fight, when he knocked out <a href="Jorge%20Arce">Jorge Arce</a> in eleven rounds at <a href="Tijuana">Tijuana</a> in 1999 to regain the <a href="WBO">WBO</a> version of the world junior flyweight championship.
Michael Carbajal and Humberto González were both elected as members of the <a href="International%20Boxing%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Boxing Hall of Fame</a> in 2006.

Bairnsdale

Bairnsdale (, locally ) is a city in <a href="East%20Gippsland">East Gippsland</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Bairnsdale has an urban area population of 11,820 with 5,576 Males, 6,244 Females and a median age of 42. The city is a major regional centre of eastern Victoria along with <a href="Traralgon%2C%20Victoria">Traralgon</a> and <a href="Sale%2C%20Victoria">Sale</a> and the commercial centre for the East Gippsland region and the seat of local government for the <a href="Shire%20of%20East%20Gippsland">Shire of East Gippsland</a>. Bairnsdale was first proclaimed a shire on 16 July 1868 and it was proclaimed as a city on 14 July 1990.
The origin of the city's name is uncertain. It would have almost have certainly been Bernisdale, with "Bernis-dale" originating from "Bjorn’s dale", or glen which indicates the Viking origins of the <a href="Skye">Skye</a> Village. Legend has it that <a href="Irish%20name">Macleod</a> was impressed by the number of Children on the run, the children of his stockmen, that he called it Bairns-dale, or "valley of the children".
In 1876 the Bairnsdale Shire, which went on to become one of the largest in Victoria in the 1880s, was led out of administrative chaos by former shire auditor and shipping agent Herman Bredt. He had also acted as a mine manager for the nearby Sons of Freedom mine. German born Bredt was the father of Bertha Bredt who married the famous Australia poet and writer <a href="Henry%20Lawson">Henry Lawson</a>. Prior to this she had worked at the <a href="http%3A//www.brhs.com.au/">Bairnsdale Hospital</a>. In this period the Main Street was fashioned but was unsealed thereby causing extensive problems of dust in the summer and mud in the winter. Asphalting didn’t take place until 1883. Nicholson Street was formed in 1877 and MacLeod Street followed in 1879.
Bairnsdale is sited on a bend of the Mitchell river, with the river flowing from the west along the northern edge of the town, before turning south to flow along the eastern edge, although suburbs are now found across the river to both north and east, e.g. Wy Yung, Eastwood and Lucknow.
The <a href="Mitchell%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Mitchell River</a> flows into <a href="Gippsland%20Lakes">Lake King and Jones Bay</a> at Eagle Point Bluff. The Mitchell, <a href="Tambo%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Tambo</a> and <a href="Nicholson%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Nicholson</a> rivers deliver a combined discharge of 1,100,000,000 litres (1,100 GL/year) into the Lakes system. The Strategic Management Plan quotes that about 100,000 tonnes of suspended solids (excluding bottom sediments) are estimated to enter the Gippsland Lakes each year from the catchments of the Mitchell, Tambo and Nicholson Rivers alone. Sediment loads from the western catchments (discharging to <a href="Lake%20Wellington">Lake Wellington</a>) deliver two to three times the nutrient and sediment loads than from the eastern catchments (Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo Rivers). Comparison of aerial photographs spanning 1935 to 1997 demonstrate that the vast majority of shorelines are eroding at an average of less than 0.1 metres per year.
The lower reaches of the <a href="Latrobe%20River">Latrobe River</a>, <a href="Thomson%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Thomson River</a> and Mitchell River flow into the <a href="Gippsland%20Lakes">Gippsland lakes</a> and have extensive <a href="floodplains">floodplains</a> in which there are large wetlands, often separated by natural <a href="levees">levees</a> from the main river channels.
The Mitchell river flats were always prone to flooding and 1891 bore witness to the flood that was only second in extent to the great floods of 1870. The biggest floods recorded were in 1893-94 with them being 76mm higher than the 1870 water levels. All floods caused the township great suffering with loss of life, infrastructure and crops. The flooding that occurred in the 1893-94 was notable for the gallantry of Patrick Piggott and George Brooks who both worked to rescue people. However, on their last trip their boat tipped as they moored it and both men were swept into the river and drowned. A witness remonstrated that; "...to the very last, they fought bravely for their lives against fearful odds". Both men are remembered upon a marble tablet installed at the Mechanics’ Hall (The Bairnsdale Library).
<a href="Mitchell%20River%20%28Victoria%29%23River%20delta%20geology">The Mitchell Delta</a> is represented as a type-L under the Ramsar wetland type classification framework, which means that it’s a permanent <a href="inland%20delta">inland delta</a>. The Mitchell Delta is a classic form of digitate delta (from Latin "digitātus", having finger or toes) and is located near the western shoreline of Lake King at Eagle Point Bluff, extending into the lake as silt jetties formed by <a href="alluvial">alluvial</a> deposition of sediment. The Mitchell Delta represents one of the finest examples of this type of landform in the world and is a site deemed of international <a href="geomorphological">geomorphological</a> significance and is one of the finest examples of a classic digitate delta in the world.
Macleod Morass and Jones Bay Wildlife Reserves cover an area of 557 ha and 123 ha respectively. The Reserves lie immediately south of Bairnsdale at the head of Lake King and on either side of the Mitchell River. According to tradition, the Tatungoloong clan of the <a href="Gunai">Gunai</a>/<a href="Kurnai">Kurnai</a> peoples were the custodians of land and waters and used the aquatic and terrestrial habitats of the area as sources of food and the surrounding open forest for shelter.
Macleod Morass formed with and was eventually isolated from Lake King and Jones Bay with the development of the Mitchell River Silt Jetties. The marginal bluff marks the former shoreline position of Lake King and the relict gravel beaches and spits were formed by wave action.
The area contains geological features and sites of State geological and geomorphological significance. The extensive 'backswamp' forming Macleod Morass, the escarpment ('marginal bluff') along its western boundary, and relict gravel beaches and spits (e.g. Brownlow’s Point) are important features providing evidence of once higher sea levels in <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>.
Macleod Morass was originally classified as a 'deep <a href="freshwater%20marsh">freshwater marsh</a>' but currently only approximately 30% of the Morass is still representative of the original classification. Water inflows to the Morass are dominated by catchment run-off from Cobblers Creek and several smaller intermittent streams, urban stormwater from McGees Gully, and direct rainfall. Major floods in the Mitchell River result in complete inundation of Macleod Morass and serve to 'flush' the entire wetland system.
Since 1939, wastewater that has been treated to varying levels has been discharged to Macleod Morass, resulting in elevated nutrient levels, reductions in water quality and changes in the distribution and abundance of vegetation. Macleod Morass Wildlife Reserve was first reserved on 16 August 1961 under the <a href="Land%20Act">Land Act</a> 1958 (Vic.) Jones Bay Wildlife Reserve was first reserved on 7 April 1961 for the Preservation of Wildlife under the Land Act. Macleod Morass and Jones Bay Wildlife Reserves occur within the Gippsland Lakes Ramsar Site, listed under the Convention on Wetlands or The <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a>.
The reserves contain a range of threatened vegetation types that provide habitat for a diverse array of wildlife including 23 threatened fauna species. Over 100 bird species, including 53 <a href="waterbird">waterbird</a> species, have been recorded within the vicinity. Eight <a href="migratory%20bird">migratory bird</a> species found in the reserves are listed under the international <a href="Japan%E2%80%93Australia%20Migratory%20Bird%20Agreement">Japan–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement</a> 1974 (JAMBA), <a href="China%E2%80%93Australia%20Migratory%20Bird%20Agreement">China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement</a> 1987 (CAMBA), and the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Migratory%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Animals">Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals</a>.
Macleod Morass is an important breeding site for Australian white ibis ("<a href="Threskiornis%20molucca">Threskiornis molucca</a>"), straw-necked ibis ("<a href="Threskiornis%20spinicollis">Threskiornis spinicollis</a>") and black-winged stilt ("<a href="Himantopus%20himantopus">Himantopus himantopus</a>"). Management strategies are in place to protect known sites of significant fauna and colonial breeding waterbirds from unnecessary disturbance, particularly the <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a> ("Haliaeetus leucogaster"), green and <a href="golden%20bell%20frog">golden bell frog</a>, <a href="warty%20bell%20frog">warty bell frog</a>, <a href="black-winged%20stilt">black-winged stilt</a>, <a href="Australian%20white%20ibis">Australian white ibis</a> and the <a href="straw%20necked%20ibis">straw necked ibis</a>.
A diverse range of 141 <a href="fauna">fauna</a> species has been identified near the reserves, including 23 fauna species listed as threatened in Victoria and three nationally vulnerable.
Some of the earlier buildings in the town are perhaps a memorial to William J. Yates, who was a prominent architect, builder and <a href="monumental%20mason">monumental mason</a>. He built the school, the old Shire Hall (1860), the Wesleyan Church and <a href="parsonage">parsonage</a> (1876), St. John’s Church, the old Bairnsdale Hospital (Cnr of McKean and Ross Streets) and the Mechanic’s Hall.
One of the most notable landmarks of Bairnsdale is the St Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Main Street known for its distinctively tall tower. Construction of St Mary’s Church was commenced in 1913, replacing an earlier brick church which had been built thirty years earlier in 1883.
Murals cover the walls and ceiling of <a href="St%20Mary">St Mary's</a> in Bairnsdale depicting <a href="saints">saints</a>, the <a href="trinity">trinity</a> and scenes of <a href="hell">hell</a>, purgatory, <a href="heaven">heaven</a> and the <a href="crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. Every year the church receives up to 80,000 visitors from all over Australia and the world. The murals were painted by out of work Italian artist Francesco Floreani during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and remain a fascination to this day.
St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church was well established when a new church building was opened on 29 April 1883. The Reverend Fr. Patrick O’Donohue was priest from 1883 to 1888. Early in the 1880s a school was opened and developed quickly so that extensions to the building were added in 1888.There were about 120 pupils in 1890. Fr Cremin oversaw the congregation from 1909 and in this period plans were drawn up to erect a magnificent brick church at an estimated £10,000. The architects were A.A. Fritsch and Harry French. Work started in August 1913 with the a stone being laid by Bishop Phelan of Sale on 19 October. The new church with its tower, described by a witness as, "a free treatment of <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style, built of brick with a slate roof".
Bairnsdale experienced growth in church numbers in the 1880s, many of them frequently recording packed congregations, particularly on special occasions. St Johns Church of England often had congregations of over 200 at the morning and evening services. The congregations of that church were headed by the Reverend E.W.S Hartmann who later lost his life crossing the flooded Mitchell River. He was succeeded by W.G. Hindley, under whom, a new brick church was built (still on the corner of Main and Pyke Streets) and opened by Bishop Moorhouse on 24 June 1884.
Bairnsdale's centre gardens stretches from the Mitchell River to the western edge of town, a distance of about . The main garden section runs for over through the central commercial district and features beds of flowering <a href="Annual%20plant">annuals</a> and <a href="Perennial%20plant">perennials</a>, numerous mature deciduous and evergreen trees, war memorials and a restored historic band <a href="Rotunda%20%28architecture%29">rotunda</a>. The rotunda was constructed in 1910 and restored to its present condition in 1993.
In 1943 the erection of a monument at the eastern end of the gardens to the district centenary led to that section being called the Centenary Garden. The <a href="Country%20Women%27s%20Association">Country Women's Association</a> (CWA) Younger set took over the beautification of the Centenary Garden in 1947 and planted a tree there in May of that year to commemorate the 21st birthday of Princess Elizabeth. Extensive tree planting with Australian native trees was carried out in the post-war years, providing a colourful display, particularly in spring and early summer.
From 1964 under the care of the town’s head gardeners, E.A. Cottrell and C.T. Harrison, the gardens had been extended westward with the planting of hardy tree’s, in particular, desert ash and flowering gum. By 1959 the highway had been extended to the foot of the hospital hill, and tree planting and lawns had provided two kilometers of gardens on the centre reserves. Garden beds were extended westward to the West End Store in 1975 with the help of people employed under the <a href="Whitlam%20Government">Whitlam Government</a> Regional Employment Development Scheme (REDS) for the unemployed. In 1969 a wishing well that was carved by Bruce Duffy of the Technical School and financed by the Rotary was erected in the Centre Gardens adjacent to the Coles Supermarket. In 1984 a plaque was added to commemorate Victoria’s 150th anniversary.
To commemorate those locals who did not return from the Boer War in 1899, a monument was unveiled in the Main Street Gardens on 12 June 1903 in the presence of <a href="John%20Forrest">Lord and Lady Forrest</a>, a number of returned men, school cadets and a large crowd of citizens.
The Bairnsdale cemetery is now located off Forge Creek road opposite the race course. Its original location was situated at punt flat, now the site of the Mitchell Gardens Holiday Park beside the river. <a href="https%3A//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%253APlaque_of_Punt_Flats_cemetery_Bairnsdale.jpg">A plaque</a> in acknowledgement of the site is located at the south-east corner of the Caravan Park. As a result of the major flooding in 1870 the site experienced erosion and reports were made that remains were washed downstream. Peter Moroney, Shire Secretary at the time, instructed William Jefferson to retrieve the remains and they were re-interred at the present cemetery.
As far back as the 1920s the cemetery was frequently criticised for its untidy appearance. It was proposed around this time that the cemetery be removed from the overseer of the council and transferred to the care of the different denominations. This was not adopted. In 1990 control of the cemetery was transferred to a community based trust. The lawn section of the cemetery was commenced in 1969. Initially wooden pegs were used to indicate grave numbers, later cloverleaf-shaped cast iron pegs were used. In 1946 a memorial garden was established for Bairnsdale's war dead. <a href="http%3A//www.cwgc.org/">The Imperial War Graves Commission</a> took over this section in 1946 and the area was attractively laid out with a fine gate and <a href="Cypress">Cypress</a> hedge, well kept lawns and white headstones, with a central memorial <a href="Cross%20of%20Sacrifice">Cross of Sacrifice</a> to the memory of the RAAF personnel who died in the Bairnsdale district during the war. <a href="Dallas%20Brooks">Sir Dallas Brooks</a> unveiled the Cross on a visit to the town on 7 September 1950. The lawn section was planned in 1964 and completed in 1970.
Frederick Jones was the earliest of the <a href="Squatting%20%28pastoral%29">squatters</a> in the Bairnsdale Shire. Jones had previously been a school teacher in <a href="Castlereagh%20Street%2C%20Sydne">Castlereagh Street, Sydne</a>. In the early 1840s Jones joined one of the early <a href="pastoralists">pastoralists</a> in the Gippsland area, William Odell Raymond, at Omeo – he was traveling south from the Wellington area where he owned land on the <a href="Macquarie%20River">Macquarie River</a> across the border in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. They arrived at the Mitchell River crossing on 20 June 1842. Once in the region Jones decided to take up the area of Lucknow. He named it such, in contrast to the other settlers Frederick Taylor and John M. Loughnan who had taken up Lindenow – the reason being that Jones had left Sydney a poor man and he felt auspicious about his new life and hence felt his ‘luck’ was on the ascendancy.
In 1848 John Archer who was a retired sea-captain was appointed manager of Lucknow Station. Jones traveled back to New South Wales to visit his run on the <a href="Murrumbidgee%20River">Murrumbidgee</a>. Archer had been a master on the "Letitia" which operated between Sydney and <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> and later, traded cattle between <a href="Port%20Albert">Port Albert</a> and Hobart. In 1845 Archer married a young girl named Eliza and brought her to Gippsland, settling at Lucknow in 1847. Eliza died in <a href="childbirth">childbirth</a> and her grave can still be seen to this day by the roadside in Crooke Street, East Bairnsdale.
The inscription on the headstone reads ‘Sown in weakness, to be raised in power’. The monument is not on the original burial position, several house blocks to the west, and has been moved down the street as houses have been built. It is thought that this headstone is the only remaining evidence that there was indeed a cemetery in this location in the 1800s.
Educational facilities in Bairnsdale include two high schools. The government funded <a href="Bairnsdale%20Secondary%20College">Bairnsdale Secondary College</a>, with approximately 1600 students, was formed in 1993 as a merger of two separate high schools; the Bairnsdale Technical College and Bairnsdale High School. <a href="Nagle%20College">Nagle College</a>, which has about 1000 students, was founded in 1958 by the <a href="Presentation%20Sisters">Presentation Sisters</a> holds to a Catholic tradition. It later adopted the <a href="Salesians%20of%20Don%20Bosco">Salesian traditions</a> of St John Bosco, with the arrival of the Salesian Society to Bairnsdale in 1990. The city also has a number of primary schools including the well established and historical <a href="http%3A//www.bairnsdale754ps.vic.edu.au/">Bairnsdale Primary School</a> and <a href="http%3A//www.bwestps.vic.edu.au/">Bairnsdale West Primary School</a> as well as the newer educational facility of <a href="http%3A//www.lucknow-ps.vic.edu.au/">Lucknow Primary School</a> located in <a href="http%3A//eastwoodbairnsdale.com.au/">Eastwood</a> as well as kindergartens and limited tertiary education facilities mainly consisting of the <a href="TAFE">East Gippsland Institute of TAFE</a>.
Bairnsdale established a reputation as a marketing and trading centre for the large rural area of East Gippsland and this has been helped by the development of excellent road systems, a good railway service and to some extent steamer and air services. The 1880s were seen as the ‘Golden Age’ for steamer traffic on the rivers and Bairnsdale was seen as one of the major colonial ports. The brick <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a> opened in 1890 with other platforms and railway infrastructure being completed at the same time. The contractor R. Kreokel won the contract for the work to be carried out for the amount of ₤2,322.
Shipping services from Bairnsdale to metropolitan areas linked with the railway so local primary producers could send their goods off to the markets in the major centre of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. As a consequence of the more frequent use of rail and the advent of refrigerated carts in 1890 which allowed dairy farmers and <a href="fishermen">fishermen</a> to appropriately transport their produce, the last coach service between Sale and Bairnsdale ran in 1889. In <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> rail services were reduced with only three trains per week direct to Bairnsdale but services were restored in 1948. In 1952 diesel trains were first used on the line and the daily train from Melbourne to Bairnsdale was named the "Gippslander". <a href="VicRail">VicRail</a> established the Bairnsdale station as a regional freight centre in 1977.
The contemporary rail transport system is still facilitated by the major railway station in Bairnsdale railway station which is the terminus of the Bairnsdale railway line. <a href="V/Line">V/Line</a> provides rail services. Performance figures for 2014 for services to Bairnsdale (long distance service) ran at 98.9% and 86.7% for reliability and punctuality, respectively. In comparison with figures from May to December 2013, the average reliability and punctuality are both down just 0.5%.
Currently, Bairnsdale Cabs provides a local taxi service around the city. Bus service is facilitated by Gillicks Bus Lines, Dysons Bus Lines (V/Line) and Goodalls Bus Lines as well as a number of others in Bairnsdale and surrounding areas.
One of the major recreational transport infrastructure systems in the city is the <a href="East%20Gippsland%20Rail%20Trail">East Gippsland Rail Trail</a> which begins in at the entrance to East Bairnsdale adjacent to Howitt Park. The track consists of <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> that extends to Nicholson where it then becomes a track made from hard base <a href="gravel">gravel</a> that forms a solid surface. Almost 100 kilometres (60 mi) in length, the multi-use trail permits running, walking, cycling and horse-riding as it follows the alignment of the former railway line to Orbost. The Bairnsdale section of the track is relatively straight, long and flat and takes users over two small bridges and crosses Phillips Lane and Morrisson Road before it intersects with the Princes Highway, which was given that name in 1920 when the <a href="Country%20Roads%20Board">Country Roads Board</a> assumed control of the whole length of highway between Melbourne and <a href="Eden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Eden</a>.
The Bairnsdale <a href="Aerodrome">Aerodrome</a> is situated on a large land area of 280ha owned wholly by East Gippsland Shire Council. It was established as part of the war effort in the 1940s. In this time, the aerodrome which is located on Bengworden Road was used as an extension to the nearby <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">East Sale R.A.A.F. Base</a> and was home to 3000 men. The main purpose of the facility was for <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> missions and navigational training over <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> and the Tasman Sea.
Earlier back in 1929 a suitable site for the aerodrome was required, with the racecourse suggested but deemed unsuitable. In 1935 submissions were made to the <a href="http%3A//www.casa.gov.au/scripts/nc.dll%3FWCMS%3AHOMEPAGE%3A%3Apc%3DHOME">Civil Aviation Department</a> to select a site. In mid 1939 the boundaries of the Aerodrome were established and buildings were erected. By 1947 the buildings were sold, dismantled and transported to the Woomera Project in South Australia.
<a href="Government%20of%20Australia">The Commonwealth Government</a> gave high priority to developing new coastal airbases at <a href="Mallacoota">Mallacoota</a> and Bairnsdale to assist in protecting <a href="shipping%20lanes">shipping lanes</a> in Bass Strait. The base became fully operational in May 1942 with the arrival of the No. 7 Squadron operating Hudson Aircraft on shipping convoy escort and <a href="anti-submarine">anti-submarine</a> patrols. At the same time the new <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> bombers were moved to Bairnsdale in June 1942. The No. 1 operation Training Unit trained 631 pupils, flew 38,875 hours and had aircraft in the air around the clock.
There were 53 crashes with aircraft being lost at sea and 71 airmen killed and others injured. In total there were 1,997 officers and airmen and 117 <a href="WAAAF">WAAAF</a> members with an additional 285 trainees. Adding to this were 12 Hudson crews and ground staff dispatched during December 1942 to assist in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> by dropping supplies to ground troops in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Buna</a> area. Two Hudsons were lost with four men killed in action and a further four being seriously injured. Before the end of the war 87 lives were lost at Bairnsdale owing to crashes or missing aircraft.
In total there were 100 aircraft based at Bairnsdale. The aircraft included 50 Beauforts, 12 <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s, 25 <a href="Airspeed%20Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a>s, 12 <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a>s and one <a href="Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moth</a>. In March 1950 Australian National Airlines launched a regular service from Bairnsdale to Melbourne with a <a href="Douglas%20DC3">DC3</a> - 24 passenger plane. A succession of companies including Ansett-ANA, Commuter Airlines, Jetair Services and Business Jets tried to establish a similar service but without any long term success. In 1966 and 1967 <a href="Helicopters">Helicopters</a> were used to transport Pipeline-laying Barge and offshore <a href="Oil%20Platform">Oil Platform</a> workers, mainly employees of the American owned <a href="http%3A//www.mcdermott.com/Pages/Home.aspx">McDermott's</a>, into Bass Strait. Since then the <a href="West%20Sale%20Airport">West Sale Airport</a> has been used extensively for this purpose. Currently the Aerodrome's facilities support a number of commercial aviation enterprises including; aerial firefighting, corporate charter, aircraft support services such as fleet maintenance, medical services such as air ambulance and courier services.
Plans were put forward in 1884 for the town’s water supply and tanks were erected in Main Street from which residents could draw water. Later John H. Grainger who designed the new <a href="Princes%20Bridge">Princes Bridge</a> in Melbourne delivered plans to build a reservoir west of the township and for this to be connected to a pumping-plant and an elevated tank in the town itself. Contracts totaling £6,132 were made for Potter and Roberts to build the reservoir. The pipes were laid by soon after with John Jefferson appointed the engineer of the works. By 1890 reticulation of the town was ready to take place.
An upgrade to the station in 1906 included installation of a new, larger cylindrical concrete tank with a capacity of 350,000 gallons, designed by (Sir) John Monash's Reinforced Concrete and Monier Pipe Construction Company. At the time this tank was a pioneering example in the State of reinforced concrete construction for water tank construction. In 1935 a dosing shed was added to the tank for chemical treatment of the water supply.
A new cylindrical, concrete pumphouse was also added in 1906, which initially housed a steam driven pump but from 1926 housed a pair of newly invented electrically powered X-pumps.
In order to supply a more consistent <a href="water%20pressure">water pressure</a> a <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> water tower was also built in Main Street in 1926-7. Measuring 100 ft high (30.48m) with a capacity of 80,000 <a href="gallons">gallons</a> the structure was constructed by <a href="civil%20engineer">civil engineer</a> Svend Haunstrup.
In 1935 another <a href="pump%20house">pump house</a> with five electric booster pumps was built on the upper level. A workshop was added in the 1950s. The pumping station continued to operate until the 1980s, when the new Woodglen storage basin at Glenaladale was complete. Today the tower sits as a well recognised icon of the Bairnsdale skyline. In 1955, costing £32,000 works commenced on new mains and pumping plants to extend reticulation to sections of West Bairnsdale and in 1958 work began on reconditioning the existing mains and pipes using cement lining.
With the increasing demand for water during the 1960s the Water Trust went ahead with plans to install a clarification plant and to set up a 90 million litre basin at Wy Yung that was to be linked with the already existing system. Plans were also slated for an additional storage basin to be built on the Mitchell River at Glenaladale. The Basin at Wy Yung was opened on the 8th of November 1972. In 1983 Government sought to reduce the number of local water trusts and sewerage authorities. The Mitchell Water Board replaced the Bairnsdale Water and Sewerage Trusts, the Paynesville Water Trust, the Lindenow Water Trust and the Bairnsdale Shire Sewerage Trust.
To ensure long term drinking water supplies, a major additional drinking water storage and water treatment plant located northwest of Bairnsdale at Woodglen entered service in mid 2010, providing a significant boost to long term <a href="water%20security">water security</a> for the region. This plant is capable of processing up to 20 megalitres of water a day and utilises a <a href="Dissolved%20air%20flotation">Dissolved Air Floatation</a>/Filtration process, more commonly known as a DAFF water treatment process. At 600 metres long, 300 metres wide and ten metres deep the facility is designed to hold 715 megalitres of water, equivalent to 715 Olympic-size swimming pools. This facility supplements Woodglen's original 850 megalitre storage. 24,000 people are reliant on the Mitchell River water supply system, from Lindenow through to Nowa Nowa, including the communities of Bairnsdale, Paynesville and Lakes Entrance.
Bairnsdale's local newspapers are the "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Bairnsdale%29">Bairnsdale Advertiser</a>" for sale on Mondays and Fridays and "East Gippsland News" delivered free on Wednesday every week. Both publications along with several others are owned and published by East Gippsland Newspapers. A unique feature of the "Bairnsdale Advertiser" is that it has continued in the same family since the 1880s. In the ten years to 1986 the paper won the John and James Cook award for non-daily Victorian newspapers. The printer has in past years also printed several books for local writers.

The town has three <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> clubs, with Bairnsdale Football Club (the Redlegs) competing in the <a href="Gippsland%20Football%20League">Gippsland Football League</a> and Lucknow and Wy Yung competing in the local <a href="East%20Gippsland%20Football%20League">East Gippsland Football League</a>. Football developed into proper competitions by the 1890s with the first football ground being set-up in Lucknow, however the game was traditionally played in front of the Main Hotel in Bairnsdale with spectators climbing the verandah’s and rooftops and balconies for a view of the game. In May 1885 a uniform consisting of a blue and white jersey, blue knickerbockers, red sockings and cap and a red sash was adopted, giving birth to the name the "Red-legs" for the team.
The first match played in team uniform was against Essendon. Matches between Bairnsdale, Sale and Maffra were also played around 1888. Bairnsdale won the Premiership against Sale in 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1899. Premierships were also won in 1902, 1903, 1908, 1912, and 1913 with Doug Potter as Captain. There were also other teams in Bairnsdale consisting of the Fire Brigade, Bruthen, Sarsfield, Cunningham and other nearby districts.
Cricket teams were set up in the 1890s with a women’s cricket team developed in 1908. The depression years hindered the progress of inter-town matches being developed over any length of time. Several matches were played between metropolitan teams and with the establishment of better rail services and a universal half-holiday on Saturdays, district cricket tended to improve. In 1892 Lord Sheffield’s visiting English Cricket team played a Gippsland team at Bairnsdale on the Bairnsdale College grounds.
Bairnsdale has a <a href="Thoroughbred%20racing%20in%20Australia">horse racing club</a>, the Bairnsdale Racing Club, which schedules around eight race meetings a year including the Bairnsdale Cup meeting usually held on the first Sunday in January.

Bait and tackle supplies, along with the required angling licenses are readily available in Bairnsdale. Bairnsdale is also home to the Bairnsdale aquatic and recreation centre (BARC) which is the largest indoor sports complex in country Victoria and contains 2 swimming pools, 3 basketball courts, several Gym rooms and the Forge theare. The Riviera triathlon club, based in Bairnsdale, run events all year round including the popular "mini tri's" on Wednesday nights at the BARC between October and March.
Bairnsdale Cycling Club run road races most weekends throughout the year taking in the scenic terrain around the Gippsland lakes and foothills of the great dividing range, the club is home to talent such as Daniel McConnell a 2 time Olympian and mountain bike world cup winner.

Letter of appointment

The "letter of appointment" is a controversial three-page document used by <a href="James%20J.%20Strang">James J. Strang</a> and his adherents in their efforts to prove that he was the designated successor to <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> as the <a href="prophet%2C%20seer%2C%20and%20revelator">prophet</a> and <a href="president%20of%20the%20Church">president</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>. Sent from <a href="Nauvoo%2C%20Illinois">Nauvoo, Illinois</a>, on June 19, 1844, to Strang in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Wisconsin">Burlington, Wisconsin</a>, this letter served as the cornerstone of Strang's claims, which were ultimately rejected by the majority of Latter Day Saints. Following Strang's murder in 1856, the letter passed through various hands until acquired by <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, where it currently forms a part of its <a href="Beinecke%20Rare%20Book%20and%20Manuscript%20Library">Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library</a>.
James J. Strang was a lawyer and newspaper editor from <a href="New%20York">New York</a> who converted to the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a> in 1844. Shortly after his baptism, Joseph Smith, founder of the church, was <a href="death%20of%20Joseph%20Smith">murdered by an anti-Mormon mob</a>. Upon Smith's death, a number of individuals came forward claiming a divine mandate to lead his church, including Strang. As a recent convert, Strang did not yet possess the name recognition among rank-and-file Mormons that was enjoyed by <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Rigdon">Sidney Rigdon</a>, two of the other contenders for leadership. Hence, Strang faced an uphill battle in his quest to be recognized as the heir to Smith's prophetic mantle.
To advance his cause, Strang asserted that unlike Rigdon and Young, he had physical proof of his prophetic calling. Strang produced a document, purportedly authored by Smith and mailed one week before his murder, prophesying his impending demise and naming Strang as his successor. The wording of the letter is somewhat ambiguous; while some interpreted it as appointing Strang solely to the presidency of the newly created Voree <a href="Stake%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Stake</a>, Strangites insist that it appoints him to Smith's prophetic office.
In his tract "The Diamond", Strang relates this version of events:
"This letter was received at Burlington by regular course of mail, coming through the distributing office at Chicago, and bears the Nauvoo postmark of June 19, the day following its date. It arrived at Burlington July 9, and was immediately taken from the office by C. P. Barnes, Esq., a distinguished lawyer at that place, who, in consequence of the rumors of persecution and civil war against the Mormons, and a general anxiety to hear the latest news, immediately carried it to Mr. Strang, with the request to be informed of any news of public interest which it might contain. It therefore became public the same evening." 
Strang offered the following alleged witnesses in Nauvoo to corroborate his story:
"Mrs. <a href="Emma%20Smith">Emma Smith</a> recollects well of her husband receiving a letter from Mr. Strang, and holding a council on the subject, and names <a href="Hyrum%20Smith">Hyrum Smith</a>, <a href="Willard%20Richards">Willard Richards</a> and <a href="John%20P.%20Greene">John P. Greene</a> as present at that council, and also that a letter was sent to Mr. Strang in answer, but of the import of the answer she was not informed."
Next, Strang accused the members of the <a href="Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve">Quorum of the Twelve</a> of conspiring together to suppress evidence of his appointment to the prophetic office–and even the possibility of murder: 
“Immediately after the martyrdom of Joseph, <a href="John%20Taylor%20%28Mormon%29">John Taylor</a>, <a href="Willard%20Richards">Willard Richards</a> and <a href="W.%20W.%20Phelps%20%28Mormon%29">William W. Phelps</a> took a kind of temporary direction of the affairs of the church, instructing the saints to wait patiently the hand of the Lord; assuring them that he had not left them without a shepherd, and that all things would be made known in due season. To every question of the saints, Who is the prophet? replies were made, in substance, that the saints would know in due season, but that nothing could be done until the Twelve got home, because the appointment of a prophet and the directions for salvation of the church from the perils they were in, was contained in sealed packages directed to them. <a href="Orson%20Hyde">Orson Hyde</a> and others of the Twelve, who were then in the east, stated in public congregations in New York, Philadelphia and other cities, that Willard Richards had written to them that the appointment of a prophet was left with him, under seal, to be opened on the return of the Twelve. This assertion was so often made that the whole church were daily expecting to hear a new prophet proclaimed. On the 8th day of August, 1844, when Sidney Rigdon endeavored to obtain authority to lead the church, John P. Green, marshal of the city of Nauvoo, told them, 'They need not trouble themselves about it, for Joseph had appointed one James J. Strang, who lived up north, to stand in his stead.' The sudden death of John P. Green immediately after this declaration (under very extraordinary circumstances) left Willard Richards and John Taylor sole repositors of all documents on this subject, except this letter." After the return of the Twelve, the alleged promise of the "sealed packages" naming Smith's successor appears to have been dropped.
When Strang's supporters attempted to use local postal records to prove that Smith had mailed the letter, they found that portion of the files could not be found. However, the records remained intact in the Chicago and Burlington post offices, showing that the letter was indeed mailed from Smith to Strang. Although Brigham Young quickly denounced Strang's missive as a "wicked forgery," this did not stop two of his associates in the Quorum of Twelve from defecting to Strang, together with <a href="William%20Marks%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">William Marks</a> (Nauvoo Stake president), members of Smith's family (including his sisters, <a href="Lucy%20Mack%20Smith">mother</a> and <a href="Emma%20Smith">widow</a>). Later, most of these would renounce Strang and join the <a href="Community%20of%20Christ">Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a>, led by Smith's son, <a href="Joseph%20Smith%20III">Joseph Smith III</a>.
Strang also claimed to have received an angelic appointment at a time coincident with Smith's death, and, like Smith, claimed the ability to translate ancient documents on metal plates into modern English. This helped Strang continue to gain converts until his assassination at the hands of disgruntled followers twelve years later.
Experts agree that the postmark on the letter is genuine. Strang's opponents challenged this during his lifetime by pointing to a tiny dot on the postmark, just before the "J" in "June"–one that they claimed should never have been there. Strang, however, produced several letters mailed from Nauvoo on June 19, all of which had this same dot. Here, said Strang, was proof that the postmark on his letter was indeed authentic.
Other critics, however, have denounced the letter as <a href="fraud">fraud</a>ulent, largely because the two sheets of paper used in creating it (making three pages for writing, and one page for the address and postmark) are from different stocks; analysis indicates that the handwriting on all three pages is the same. References to Strang's alleged appointment appear throughout the letter. One page one: "The faith which thou hast in the Shepherd, the stone of Israel [Joseph Smith], hath been repaid to thee a thousandfold, and thou shalt be like unto him; but the flock shall find rest with thee, and God shall reveal to thee his will concerning them". Page two continues: "[H]e [Strang] had faith in thee [Smith], the Shepherd and Stone of Israel, and to him shall the gathering of the people be". Page three: "Thy duty is made plain ... [I]f evil befall me, thou shalt lead the flock to pleasant pastures."
Some modern analysts have asserted that Smith's signature on the letter's third page is a <a href="forgery">forgery</a>. One former Strangite insisted that Strang's law partner–the same "C. P. Barnes, Esq." mentioned by Strang in "The Diamond"–helped Strang fabricate this letter and the <a href="Voree%20plates">Voree plates</a>, though no proof of this was ever produced.
One theory is that Strang did indeed receive a letter of some sort from Smith, in which a blank sheet of paper was used for the envelope. According to this theory, Strang discarded the contents of that letter and proceeded to author his "letter of appointment" using the blank outer sheet for the final page of its text. Such a maneuver would have assured Strang of an authentic postmark for his letter.
The "letter of appointment" is still accepted and defended by members of the <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter%20Day%20Saints%20%28Strangite%29">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)</a>.

8 (New York City Subway service)

8 was a designation given to several services of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a>. It was first used by the <a href="Brooklyn%E2%80%93Manhattan%20Transit%20Corporation">Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation</a> for their <a href="BMT%20Astoria%20Line">Astoria Line</a> from 1917 until 1949. Then, the ex-<a href="Interborough%20Rapid%20Transit%20Company">Interborough Rapid Transit Company</a> (IRT) <a href="Third%20Avenue%20El">Third Avenue El</a> used the designation for six years, between 1967 and 1973.
The 8 label was first used for the <a href="BMT%20Astoria%20Line">Astoria Line</a>, which opened on February 1, 1917, as an extension of the <a href="Queensboro%20Line">Queensboro Line</a> (now part of the <a href="IRT%20Flushing%20Line">Flushing line</a>) from <a href="Queensboro%20Plaza%20%28IRT%20Flushing%20Line%29">Queensboro Plaza</a>. The <a href="IRT%20Flushing%20Line">Corona Line</a> (now also part of the Flushing Line) had already been built as another branch from Queensboro Plaza; when the Astoria Line opened half the trains ran to each terminal. At the time, the Queensboro Line ended on the other side of the <a href="Steinway%20Tunnel">Steinway Tunnel</a> at <a href="Grand%20Central%20%28IRT%20Flushing%20Line%29">Grand Central</a>.
Tracks opened over the <a href="Queensboro%20Bridge">Queensboro Bridge</a> on July 23, 1917, allowing <a href="elevated%20railway">elevated trains</a> of the <a href="IRT%20Second%20Avenue%20Line">IRT Second Avenue Line</a> to operate to Queensborough Plaza and then over either the Astoria or Corona line. Once this link opened, all elevated trains went to Astoria, and all subway trains to Corona, but this was modified by 1923, with both divisions running on each line. On March 22, 1926, the Queensborough Line (and Astoria service) was extended west to <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20%28IRT%20Flushing%20Line%29">Fifth Avenue</a>, and it was completed west to <a href="Times%20Square%20%28IRT%20Flushing%20Line%29">Times Square</a> on March 14, 1927.
<a href="Brooklyn-Manhattan%20Transit%20Corporation">BMT</a> <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway%20shuttles">shuttles</a> (coincidentally also labeled <a href="BMT%208">8</a>) began using the Astoria Line on April 8, 1923, with a transfer to the <a href="BMT%20Broadway%20Line">Broadway Line</a> at Queensborough Plaza. This joint operation ended on October 17, 1949, and all IRT trains started operating to Flushing (where the Corona Line had been extended in 1928) and all BMT trains operated to Astoria. The numbers were only publicly used starting in 1948, so the public only knew the Astoria Line's IRT services as the 8 for about a year.
When the <a href="Chrystie%20Street%20Connection">Chrystie Street Connection</a> opened in late 1967, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Transit%20Authority">TA</a> assigned labels to all services. The only remaining <a href="Interborough%20Rapid%20Transit%20Company">IRT</a> <a href="elevated%20railway">elevated line</a>, the <a href="IRT%20Third%20Avenue%20Line">IRT Third Avenue Line</a> in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, was too long to be a <a href="S%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29">shuttle</a>, so was assigned the number 8, unused since 1949. This service, running between <a href="149th%20Street%20%28IRT%20Third%20Avenue%20Line%29">149th Street</a> and <a href="Gun%20Hill%20Road%20%28IRT%20White%20Plains%20Road%20Line%29">Gun Hill Road</a>, last ran on April 28, 1973, when the Third Avenue Line closed. Thereafter, it was <a href="Rail%20replacement%20bus%20service">replaced</a> by the bus route until 2013, when most of the former route started being served by the <a href="Bx15%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">Bx15 Limited</a>. The 8 bullet was only marked on maps and station signs, never on cars. Cars instead displayed <a href="S%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%20service%29">SHUTTLE</a> and the destination.
Current <a href="rollsign">rollsign</a>s have an 8 (as well as a ' and a ') in an circle, the same color as the ', ' and , the <a href="IRT%20Lexington%20Avenue%20Line">IRT Lexington Avenue Line</a> services.

Sutton (Surrey) railway station

Sutton railway station is in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Sutton">London Borough of Sutton</a> in <a href="south%20London">south London</a>. It is the main station for <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> town. It is served by <a href="Southern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southern</a> and <a href="Thameslink%20and%20Great%20Northern">Thameslink</a> trains. It is in <a href="Travelcard%20Zone%205">Travelcard Zone 5</a>.
Sutton station was opened by the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> (LB&amp;SCR) on 10 May 1847 when the railway opened its line from <a href="West%20Croydon%20railway%20station">West Croydon</a> to <a href="Epsom%20railway%20station">Epsom</a>. A branch to <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20railway%20station">Epsom Downs</a> was opened on 22 May 1865 followed by a line to <a href="Mitcham%20Junction%20station">Mitcham Junction</a> on 1 October 1868. The final change to the station came when the branch to <a href="Wimbledon%20station">Wimbledon</a> opened on 5 January 1930. Until the early 1980s, it was possible to catch a direct express train to the coast from here to Bognor Regis, Chichester and Portsmouth. This service, until its withdrawal, also gave Sutton the fastest ever journey time of 17 minutes to London Victoria. Since the 1980s, these express services are routed via East Croydon to serve Gatwick Airport and passengers from Sutton for the south coast now have to change at <a href="Horsham%20railway%20station">Horsham</a> or travel to <a href="West%20Croydon%20railway%20station">West Croydon</a> and walk, take the bus or use Croydon's <a href="Tramlink">Tramlink</a> service to get to <a href="East%20Croydon%20railway%20station">East Croydon</a>. 
Today, the service to London Victoria takes just over 25 minutes on the direct route via Hackbridge.
The four platforms at Sutton station are numbered 1 to 4 from north to south. Platforms 1 and 2 are on the lines to <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a>, <a href="Epsom">Epsom</a>, <a href="Leatherhead">Leatherhead</a>, <a href="Dorking">Dorking</a>, and <a href="Horsham">Horsham</a>. Platforms 3 and 4 are on the <a href="Epsom%20Downs%20railway%20line">Epsom Downs Line</a>, which becomes single track about south of the station. Platforms 1 and 3 are used by services from outer termini to Central London. Trains from Central London use platforms 2 and 4. Terminating trains which return to central London generally use platform 4.
Platforms 1 and 2 can accommodate 12-coach trains and were used by the express services to and Portsmouth until they were diverted in the early 1980s to serve Gatwick Airport. Nowadays all trains calling at Sutton are formed of ten coaches or fewer. At the London end of platform 1 there are the remains of a fifth platform which was a bay for local services via <a href="Mitcham%20Junction%20station">Mitcham Junction</a>.
Two waiting rooms serve the station: one has its own cafe; the other has a <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> kiosk adjacent. An <a href="Marks%20and%20Spencer">M&amp;S Food to Go</a> shop sits adjacent to the concourse within the station building.
Three lifts serve all platforms - one each for platforms one, two/three and four. 
The installation of a side entrance serving the Quadrant was completed in Summer 2014.
Parliamentary approval for a line from <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> to <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> had been obtained by the <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Sutton%20Railway">Wimbledon and Sutton Railway</a> (W&amp;SR) in 1910 but work had been delayed by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. From the W&amp;SR's inception, the <a href="Metropolitan%20District%20Railway">Metropolitan District Railway</a> (MDR) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> (LER, precursor of <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>) planned, through its ownership of the MDR, to use part of the route for an extension of the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> (C&amp;SLR, now the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>) to Sutton. The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&amp;SLR to extend as far as <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a> in exchange for the LER giving up its rights over the W&amp;SR route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. The line opened on 5 January 1930 when full services on the line were extended from South Merton.
The typical off-peak service from the station is:
On a Sunday the service from this station is:
<a href="London%20Buses">London Buses</a> routes <a href="London%20Buses%20route%2080">80</a>, <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20164">164</a>, <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20280">280</a>, <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20470">470</a>, <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20S1">S1</a>, <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20S3">S3</a> and <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20S4">S4</a>, night route <a href="London%20Buses%20route%20N44">N44</a> and non-TFL route 420 serve the station.

Butterfly doors

Butterfly doors or vertical doors are a type of <a href="door">door</a> sometimes seen on high-performance <a href="car">car</a>s. They are similar to <a href="scissor%20doors">scissor doors</a>. While scissor doors move straight up via hinge points at the "bottom" of the <a href="Pillar_%28automobile%29">A-pillar</a>, butterfly doors move up and out via hinges "along" the A-pillar. This makes for easier entry/exit at the expense of requiring more opening space than needed for scissor doors.
The <a href="McLaren%20F1">McLaren F1</a>, <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%2033%20Stradale">Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale</a>, <a href="Saleen%20S7">Saleen S7</a>, <a href="Enzo%20Ferrari%20%28car%29">Enzo Ferrari</a> and its non road-going version;the <a href="Ferrari%20FXX">FXX</a>, <a href="Toyota%20Sera">Toyota Sera</a>/EXY-10, and the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20SLR%20McLaren">Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren</a>, among others, use butterfly doors. It was also a common feature for <a href="Group%20C">Group C</a> and <a href="IMSA%20GT%20Championship">IMSA GTP/Camel Lights</a> prototype racers as they incorporate teardrop tops which allows the driver to get in and out of the car more quickly than conventional and gullwing doors, especially in a cramped pitlane environment such as the pre-1991 <a href="Circuit%20de%20la%20Sarthe">Le Mans</a> circuit. Since then, butterfly doors have been an adopted design of closed top <a href="sportscar%20racing">sportscar racers</a>, such as the <a href="Toyota%20GT-One">Toyota GT-One</a>, <a href="Bentley%20Speed%208">Bentley Speed 8</a> and more recently, the <a href="Peugeot%20908%20HDi%20FAP">Peugeot 908 HDi FAP</a>. The Toyota Sera, made between 1990 and 1995, was a limited-release car designed exclusively for the <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese market which used this design. The <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20SLR%20McLaren%23Roadster">Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Roadster</a> was one of the few open top cars to use butterfly wing doors. This is made possible by having the doors hinged at the side of A-pillar instead of at top by the roof. The <a href="McLaren%20MP4-12C">McLaren MP4-12C</a> has a unique system where the butterfly doors do not use a top hinge meaning that the car can use frameless windows which allows for the car's upcoming convertible version to retain them.
The <a href="BMW%20i8">BMW i8</a> has butterfly doors in both its concept version and final production version.

Egoli: Place of Gold

Egoli: Place of Gold is a long-running bilingual (English and <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>) <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> which first aired on <a href="M-Net">M-Net</a> on 6 April 1992. South African television's first daily soap opera, on 3 December 1999 "Egoli" became the first South African television program in any genre to reach 2,000 episodes. As of 3 August 2007, 4,000 episodes had aired. "Egoli: Place of Gold" aired its final episode on 31 March 2010, after 18 years of acting from South African and international actors.
The series was set in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, which is sometimes referred to as eGoli. "Egoli" was created by Franz Marx. The show is known in Afrikaans as "Egoli: Plek van Goud."
"Egoli" was "aimed at women of all nationalities between the ages of 25 and 45, with middle or upper incomes." The series aired Monday to Friday at 18:00. However on from April 2009, M-Net moved Egoli to the 18:30 timeslot.
The series had a large following, and ""Egoli" Spectaculars" were held countrywide each year for fans of the series to meet the cast. These spectaculars offered publicity for the series but also raised money for charity.
Cast members included--
International Guest stars:
The TV series was broadcast outside of South Africa, in neighboring countries in the original bilingual Afrikaans-English version, and, beginning in May 1997, in an English-only international version. The bilingual version was shown in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, where Afrikaans was spoken or widely understood. In the late 1990s, the English version was broadcast in at least 9 African countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mauritius.
At one time in the 1990s, the series was shown in at least 30 countries.
In creating the international version, all Afrikaans-language scenes were filmed twice, first in Afrikaans, then in English. To make the series more appealing to non-South African audiences, typical South African sayings and customs, were deleted from the international edition.
"Egoli" was also dubbed in Spanish for broadcast in some South American countries.
Egoli: Place of Gold was one of the South African soaps to be parodied by <a href="comedian">comedian</a> <a href="Casper%20de%20Vries">Casper de Vries</a> in his soap parody Haak en Steek.
The final episode of the series aired on 31 March 2010. The final episode included surprises and special guests and ended at the memorial.
It was announced in August 2009 that a movie entitled "Egoli - The Movie" would conclude the longest-running soap opera in South African history. The movie was produced by series creator and writer Franz Marx, in cooperation with Burgert Muller, a co-producer of the TV series, and Pieter Venter of Brigadiers-Franz Marx Films. The feature film was released in South African cinemas on 16 June 2010 and starred many cast members from the TV show including David Rees, Shaleen Surtie-Richards, Tiffany Kelly, Christine Basson, Brümilda van Rensburg, and Lerato Motau. Some sources list the title of the movie as "Egoli: Afrikaners is Plesierig."
A book entitled "Franz Marx's Egoli 2000" by Reinet Louw was published by Human &amp; Rousseau in 1999. The English-language edition was a translation of the Afrikaans-language edition, "Franz Marx se Egoli 2000," also published in 1999. The book related how the show was developed, recounted storylines from the first 8 years of the show, provided biographical sketches of characters, and included photographs of cast members.
A cookbook featuring recipes by characters in the series (including Nenna, Elsa, Donna, and Mrs. Naidoo) was published during the program's run and ranked number 1 on the South African top ten best-seller list for several weeks. The recipes featured in the cookbook were collected by South African restaurateurs Eduan Naudé and Brian Shalkoff.
During the early years of its run, the TV show marketed a sticker book and stickers featuring pictures of the actors from the series.
After the series concluded in 2010, a double-disc DVD entitled "Egoli 18" was released. The DVD featured highlights from each year of the series' 18-year-run, repackaged into new 24-minute episodes by the show's creator, Franz Marx. Episodes were introduced by actors, writers, and other notable personalities who were affiliated with or fans of the show.
The show also marketed its own fragrance. The perfume, named "Essence of Gold."
Clothes featured in the TV series, designed by fictional character Freddie Vermeulen of Louwna Fashions, were also sold in South African shops at one time.

<doc id="1639000" title="Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639000">
Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād

Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād (c. 1450 – c. 1535), also known as Kamal al-din Bihzad or Kamaleddin Behzad (), was a <a href="Persian%20miniature">Persian painter</a> and head of the royal ateliers in <a href="Herat">Herat</a> and <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> during the late <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid</a> and early <a href="Safavid">Safavid</a> <a href="Iran">Persian</a> periods.
Although very little information is known about the geographical background of the artist, it is known that he lived in the time of the <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurids</a>, and later in <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a> under the Safavid dynasty. An orphan, he was raised by the prominent painter <a href="Mirak%20Naqqash">Mirak Naqqash</a>, and was a protégé of <a href="Ali%20Shir%20Nava%27i">Mir Ali Shir Nava'i</a>. His major patrons in Herat were the Timurid sultan <a href="Husayn%20Bayqarah">Husayn Bayqarah</a> (ruled 1469 - 1506) and other <a href="amirs">amirs</a> in his circle. After the fall of the Hamad, he was employed by <a href="Shah%20Ismail%20I">Shah Ismail I</a> <a href="Safavi">Safavi</a> in Tabriz, where, as director of the royal atelier, he had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid painting.
Behzad died in 1535 and his tomb is located in <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, in Saeede Mukhtar which is located in north of Herat city on the top of a hill. A statue of Behzad is placed in <a href="2-Kamal%20Tomb">2-Kamal Tomb</a>.
Behzad is the most famous of <a href="Persian%20miniature">Persian miniature</a> painters, though he is more accurately understood as the director of a workshop (or kitabkhāna) producing <a href="manuscript%20illuminations">manuscript illuminations</a> in a style he conceived. Persian painting of the period frequently uses an arrangement of geometric architectural elements as the structural or compositional context in which the figures are arranged. Behzad is equally skilled with the organic areas of landscape, but where he uses the traditional geometric style Behzad stretches that compositional device in a couple ways. One is that he often uses open, unpatterned empty areas around which action moves. Also he pins his compositions to a mastery at moving the eye of the observer around the picture plane in a quirky organic flow. The gestures of figures and objects are not only uniquely natural, expressive and active, they are arranged to keep moving the eye throughout the picture plane. He uses value (dark-light contrast) more emphatically, and skillfully than other medieval miniaturists. Another quality common to his work is narrative playfulness: the almost hidden eye and partial face of Bahram as he peers out the blinds to watch the frolicing girls in the pool below, the upright goat that looks like a demon along the edge of the horizon in a story about an old woman confronting the sins of Sanjar, the amazing cosmopolitan variety of humans working on the wall in the sample image. This surprising individuality of character and narrative creativity are some qualities that distinguish Bezhad's works and that match their literary intent. Behzad also uses <a href="Sufi">Sufi</a> symbolism and symbolic colour to convey meaning. He introduced greater naturalism to Persian painting, particularly in the depiction of more individualised figures and the use of realistic gestures and expressions.
Behzad's most famous works include "The Seduction of Yusuf" from <a href="Saadi%20%28poet%29">Sa'di</a>'s <a href="Bostan%20%28book%29">Bustan</a> of 1488, and paintings from the British Library's <a href="Nizami%20Ganjavi">Nizami</a> manuscript of 1494-95 - particularly scenes from "<a href="Layla%20and%20Majnun">Layla and Majnun</a>" and the "Haft Paykar" (see accompanying image). The attribution of specific paintings to Behzad himself is often problematic (and, many academics would now argue, unimportant), but the majority of works commonly attributed to him date from 1488 to 1495.
He is also mentioned in <a href="Orhan%20Pamuk">Orhan Pamuk</a>'s famous novel "My Name is Red" as one of the greatest Persian miniature painters.

Geometric invariant theory

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> Geometric invariant theory (or GIT) is a method for constructing quotients by <a href="group%20action">group action</a>s in <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>, used to construct <a href="moduli%20space">moduli space</a>s. It was developed by <a href="David%20Mumford">David Mumford</a> in 1965, using ideas from the paper in classical <a href="invariant%20theory">invariant theory</a>. 
Geometric invariant theory studies an <a href="group%20action">action of a group</a> "G" on an <a href="algebraic%20variety">algebraic variety</a> (or <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">scheme</a>) "X" and provides techniques for forming the 'quotient' of "X" by "G" as a scheme with reasonable properties. One motivation was to construct <a href="moduli%20space">moduli space</a>s in <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> as quotients of schemes parametrizing marked objects. In the 1970s and 1980s the theory developed 
interactions with <a href="symplectic%20geometry">symplectic geometry</a> and <a href="equivariant%20topology">equivariant topology</a>, and was used to construct moduli spaces of objects in <a href="differential%20geometry">differential geometry</a>, such as <a href="instanton">instanton</a>s and <a href="monopole%20%28mathematics%29">monopoles</a>.
Invariant theory is concerned with a <a href="group%20action">group action</a> of a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> "G" on an <a href="algebraic%20variety">algebraic variety</a> (or a <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">scheme</a>) "X". Classical invariant theory addresses the situation when "X" = "V" is a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a> and "G" is either a finite group, or one of the <a href="classical%20Lie%20group">classical Lie group</a>s that acts linearly on "V". This action induces a linear action of "G" on the space of <a href="Ring%20of%20polynomial%20functions">polynomial functions</a> "R"("V") on "V" by the formula
The polynomial <a href="invariant%20%28mathematics%29">invariant</a>s of the "G"-action on "V" are those polynomial functions "f" on "V" which are fixed under the 'change of variables' due to the action of the group, so that "g"·"f" = "f" for all "g" in "G". They form a commutative algebra "A" = "R"("V"), and this algebra is interpreted as the algebra of functions on the '<a href="GIT%20quotient">invariant theory quotient</a>' "V" //"G". In the language of modern <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>,
Several difficulties emerge from this description. The first one, successfully tackled by Hilbert in the case of a <a href="general%20linear%20group">general linear group</a>, is to prove that the algebra "A" is finitely generated. This is necessary if one wanted the quotient to be an <a href="affine%20algebraic%20variety">affine algebraic variety</a>. Whether a similar fact holds for arbitrary groups "G" was the subject of <a href="Hilbert%27s%20fourteenth%20problem">Hilbert's fourteenth problem</a>, and <a href="Masayoshi%20Nagata">Nagata</a> demonstrated that the answer was negative in general. On the other hand, in the course of development of <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a> in the first half of the twentieth century, a large class of groups for which the answer is positive was identified; these are called <a href="reductive%20group">reductive group</a>s and include all finite groups and all classical groups. 
The finite generation of the algebra "A" is but the first step towards the complete description of "A", and the progress in resolving this more delicate question was rather modest. The invariants had classically been described only in a restricted range of situations, and the complexity of this description beyond the first few cases held out little hope for full understanding of the algebras of invariants in general. Furthermore, it may happen that all polynomial invariants "f" take the same value on a given pair of points "u" and "v" in "V", yet these points are in different <a href="orbit%20%28group%20theory%29">orbits</a> of the "G"-action. A simple example is provided by the multiplicative group C of non-zero complex numbers that acts on an "n"-dimensional complex vector space C by scalar multiplication. In this case, every polynomial invariant is a constant, but there are many different orbits of the action. The zero vector forms an orbit by itself, and the non-zero multiples of any non-zero vector form an orbit, so that non-zero orbits are parametrized by the points of the complex <a href="projective%20space">projective space</a> CP. If this happens, one says that "invariants do not separate the orbits", and the algebra "A" reflects the topological <a href="Quotient%20space%20%28topology%29">quotient space</a> "X" /"G" rather imperfectly. Indeed, the latter space is frequently <a href="Hausdorff%20space">non-separated</a>. In 1893 Hilbert formulated and proved a criterion for determining those orbits which are not separated from the zero orbit by invariant polynomials. Rather remarkably, unlike his earlier work in invariant theory, which led to the rapid development of <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, this result of Hilbert remained little known and little used for the next 70 years. Much of the development of invariant theory in the first half of the twentieth century concerned explicit computations with invariants, and at any rate, followed the logic of algebra rather than geometry.
Geometric invariant theory was founded and developed by Mumford in a monograph, first published in 1965, that applied ideas of nineteenth century invariant theory, including some results of <a href="David%20Hilbert">Hilbert</a>, to modern algebraic geometry questions. (The book was greatly expanded in two later editions, with extra appendices by Fogarty and Mumford, and a chapter on symplectic quotients by Kirwan.) The book uses both <a href="scheme%20theory">scheme theory</a> and computational techniques available in examples. 
The abstract setting used is that of a <a href="group%20action">group action</a> on a scheme "X".
The simple-minded idea of an <a href="orbit%20space">orbit space</a> 
i.e. the <a href="Quotient%20space%20%28topology%29">quotient space</a> of "X" by the group action, runs into difficulties in algebraic geometry, for reasons that are explicable in abstract terms. There is in fact no general reason why <a href="equivalence%20relation">equivalence relation</a>s should interact well with the (rather rigid) <a href="regular%20function">regular function</a>s (polynomial functions), which are at the heart of algebraic geometry. The functions on the orbit space "G"\"X" that should be considered are those on "X" that are <a href="Invariant%20%28mathematics%29">invariant</a> under the action of "G". The direct approach can be made, by means of the <a href="function%20field%20of%20an%20algebraic%20variety">function field</a> of a variety (i.e. <a href="rational%20function">rational function</a>s): take the <a href="G-invariant">"G"-invariant</a> rational functions on it, as the function field of the <a href="quotient%20variety">quotient variety</a>. Unfortunately this — the point of view of <a href="birational%20geometry">birational geometry</a> — can only give a first approximation to the answer. As Mumford put it in the Preface to the book:
In Chapter 5 he isolates further the specific technical problem addressed, in a <a href="moduli%20problem">moduli problem</a> of quite classical type — classify the big 'set' of all algebraic varieties subject only to being <a href="non-singular">non-singular</a> (and a requisite condition on <a href="polarization%20of%20an%20algebraic%20variety">polarization</a>). The moduli are supposed to describe the parameter space. For example for <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a>s it has been known from the time of <a href="Riemann">Riemann</a> that there should be <a href="connected%20space">connected component</a>s of dimensions 
according to the <a href="genus%20%28curve%29">genus</a> "g" =0, 1, 2, 3, 4, …, and the moduli are functions on each component. In the <a href="coarse%20moduli%20problem">coarse moduli problem</a> Mumford considers the obstructions to be:
It is the third point that motivated the whole theory. As Mumford puts it, if the first two difficulties are resolved
To deal with this he introduced a notion (in fact three) of stability. This enabled him to open up the previously treacherous area — much had been written, in particular by <a href="Francesco%20Severi">Francesco Severi</a>, but the methods of the literature had limitations. The birational point of view can afford to be careless about subsets of <a href="codimension">codimension</a> 1. To have a moduli space as a scheme is on one side a question about characterising schemes as <a href="representable%20functor">representable functor</a>s (as the <a href="Grothendieck">Grothendieck</a> school would see it); but geometrically it is more like a <a href="compactification%20%28mathematics%29">compactification</a> question, as the stability criteria revealed. The restriction to non-singular varieties will not lead to a <a href="compact%20space">compact space</a> in any sense as moduli space: varieties can degenerate to having singularities. On the other hand the points that would correspond to highly singular varieties are definitely too 'bad' to include in the answer. The correct middle ground, of points stable enough to be admitted, was isolated by Mumford's work. The concept was not entirely new, since certain aspects of it were to be found in <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>'s final ideas on invariant theory, before he moved on to other fields.
The book's Preface also enunciated the <a href="haboush%27s%20theorem">Mumford conjecture</a>, later proved by <a href="William%20Haboush">William Haboush</a>.
If a reductive group "G" acts linearly on a vector space "V", then a non-zero point of "V" is called
There are equivalent ways to state these (this criterion is known as the <a href="Hilbert%E2%80%93Mumford%20criterion">Hilbert–Mumford criterion</a>):
A point of the corresponding projective space of "V" is called unstable, semi-stable, or stable if it is the 
image of a point in "V" with the same property. "Unstable" is the opposite of "semistable" (not "stable"). The unstable points form a Zariski closed set of projective space, while the semistable and stable points both form Zariski open sets (possibly empty). These definitions are from and are not equivalent to the ones in the first edition of Mumford's book.
Many moduli spaces can be constructed as the quotients of the space of stable points of some subset of projective space by some group action. These spaces can often be compactified by adding certain equivalence classes of semistable points. Different stable orbits correspond to different points in the quotient, but two different semistable orbits may correspond to the same point in the quotient if their closures intersect. 
Example: 
A <a href="stable%20curve">stable curve</a> is a reduced connected curve of genus ≥2 such that its only singularities are ordinary double points and every non-singular rational component meets the other components in at least 3 points. The moduli space of stable curves of genus "g" is the quotient of a subset of the <a href="Hilbert%20scheme">Hilbert scheme</a> of curves in P with Hilbert polynomial (6"n"−1)("g"−1) by the group PGL.
Example:
A vector bundle "W" over an <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a> (or over a <a href="Riemann%20surface">Riemann surface</a>) is a <a href="stable%20vector%20bundle">stable vector bundle</a> 
if and only if 
for all proper non-zero subbundles "V" of "W" 
and is semistable if this condition holds with

Gippsland Lakes

The Gippsland Lakes are a network of lakes, marshes and lagoons in east <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> covering an area of about . The largest of the lakes are Lake Wellington (<a href="Gunai%20language">Gunai language</a>: Murla), Lake King and Lake Victoria. The lakes are collectively fed by the <a href="Avon%20River%20%28Eastern%20Victoria%29">Avon</a>, <a href="Thomson%20River%2C%20Victoria">Thomson</a>, <a href="Latrobe%20River">Latrobe</a>, <a href="Mitchell%20River%2C%20Victoria">Mitchell</a>, <a href="Nicholson%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Nicholson</a> and <a href="Tambo%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Tambo</a> rivers.
The Gippsland Lakes were formed by two principal processes. The first is <a href="river%20delta">river delta</a> <a href="alluvium">alluvial</a> deposition of sediment brought in by the rivers which flow into the lakes. Silt deposited by this process forms into long jetties which can run many kilometres into a lake, as exemplified by the <a href="Mitchell%20River%20silt%20jetties">Mitchell River silt jetties</a> that run into Lake King. The second process is the <a href="Bar%20%28landform%29%23Sandbars%20and%20longshore%20bars">action of sea current in Bass Strait</a> which created the <a href="Ninety%20Mile%20Beach%2C%20Victoria">Ninety Mile Beach</a> and cut off the river deltas from the sea.
Once the lakes were closed off a new cycle started, whereby the water level of the lakes would gradually rise until the waters broke through the <a href="Ninety%20Mile%20Beach%2C%20Victoria">barrier beach</a> and the level would drop down until it equalised with sea-level. Eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin anew. Sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and not necessarily in the same place as the last one.
In 1889 a wall was built to fix the position of a naturally occurring channel between the lakes and the ocean at <a href="Lakes%20Entrance">Lakes Entrance</a>, to stabilise the water level, create a harbour for fishing boats and open up the lakes to shipping. This entrance needs to be dredged regularly, or the same process that created the Gippsland Lakes would render the entrance too shallow for seagoing vessels to pass through.
Due to the flooding, in 2011, Gippsland Lakes were experiencing bioluminescence.
The Gippsland Lakes provide a major hub for tourism, particularly for recreational boating and fishing enthusiasts. The lakes network can be explored by cruise, water taxi, or boat and kayak hire. On the fringes of the lakes are several tourist towns that swell to support the tourist trade, particularly in the summer months.
<a href="Lakes%20Entrance%2C%20Victoria">Lakes Entrance</a> is the largest of the towns on the lakes with a population of 4,500. The town is well serviced with resorts, hotels and facilities. It is located with easy access to both the lakes network and the surf beach on <a href="Ninety%20Mile%20Beach%2C%20Victoria">Ninety Mile Beach</a>, which is patrolled each summer.
<a href="Metung">Metung</a> is a small village located on the tip of a peninsula sitting in the Gippsland Lakes, surrounded almost completely by water. It is an upmarket tourist destination with many dining options and artisan galleries.
Much of <a href="Paynesville%2C%20Victoria">Paynesville</a>’s accommodation and infrastructure are located on the network of canals. One of the key attractions is <a href="Raymond%20Island">Raymond Island</a>, known for its koala population.
The diversity of the brine waters of the lakes, surf beaches along Ninety Mile Beach and fresh water streams that feed the lakes, make the Gippsland Lakes a popular fishing destination. Local fish varieties include bream, mullet, flathead, luderick and trevally. Paynesville, Lakes Entrance and Metung all offer a number of jetties, boat ramps and berthing facilities.
The lakes support numerous species of wildlife and there exist two protected areas within: <a href="The%20Lakes%20National%20Park">The Lakes National Park</a> and Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The Gippsland Lakes wetlands are protected by the international <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a> on wetlands. There are also approximately 400 indigenous flora species and 300 native fauna species. Three plants, two of them being <a href="orchid">orchid</a> species, are listed as endangered. The numbers of <a href="southern%20right%20whale">southern right whale</a>s and <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s using the Lake Entrance area show increases in recent years as the populations started to recover from illegal hunts by Soviet Union with helps by Japan in 1960s-70s.
The lakes are home to about 50 of the recently described species of <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>, the <a href="Burrunan%20dolphin">Burrunan dolphin</a> ("Tursiops australis"). The other 150 or so of this rare species are to be found in <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a>.
The wetlands provide habitat for about 20,000 waterbirds – including birds from as far afield as <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. The lakes have been identified by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> as an <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a> (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the global populations of <a href="black%20swan">black swan</a>s, <a href="chestnut%20teal">chestnut teal</a>s and <a href="musk%20duck">musk duck</a>s, as well as many <a href="fairy%20tern">fairy tern</a>s.

Community council

A community council is a public representative body in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. 
In <a href="England">England</a> they may be statutory <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish councils</a> by another name, under the <a href="Local%20Government%20and%20Public%20Involvement%20in%20Health%20Act%202007">Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007</a>, or they may be non-statutory bodies. In <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a> they are <a href="statute">statutory</a> bodies.
Scottish community councils were first created under the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201973">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</a>, many years after Scottish parish councils were abolished by the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201929">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929</a>.
Welsh community councils are a direct replacement for earlier parish councils, under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, and are identical to English parish councils in terms of their powers and the way they operate.
In England, a <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish council</a> can call itself a "community council", as an 'alternative style' under the <a href="Local%20Government%20and%20Public%20Involvement%20in%20Health%20Act%202007">Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007</a>. In the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Oldham">Metropolitan Borough of Oldham</a> and the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Southwark">London Borough of Southwark</a> non-statutory consultation bodies have been established, called community councils. There are thirty-eight charitable <a href="Rural%20Community%20Council">Rural Community Council</a>s with a rural development function, covering areas such as community planning, community buildings support, rural transport schemes and rural affordable housing (exception sites). The rural community councils are linked by the charity ACRE <a href="Action%20with%20Communities%20in%20Rural%20England">Action with Communities in Rural England</a> (www.acre.org.uk) and form the Rural Community Action Network (RCAN)
In Scotland community councils have fewer powers than their English or Welsh counterparts. As of July 2012, there were 1,369 community council areas in Scotland, some of which represent several communities within their boundary.
Community councils were introduced in 1975 under the <a href="Local%20Government%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201973">Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</a>. The duty was placed on the newly established district councils to prepare an establishment scheme to divide their district into community council areas. In 1996 this duty passed to the present <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20Scotland">area councils</a>. 
Scotland's network of <a href="List%20of%20civil%20parishes%20in%20Scotland">parish</a>es was abolished for administrative purposes in 1930, when larger district councils were formed. Unlike Wales, the new CCs created in 1975 were not necessarily based on old parish areas, which no longer fit any modern administrative areas. Several of them are based on former <a href="burgh">burgh</a>s, and have rematriculated the burgh <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> and use the title "provost" for their chairman.
The Acts of Parliament governing Community Councils allow for them to "take any action" they deem appropriate to improve their community. They set out the requirements of each local authority's "scheme for the establishment of Community Councils". 
All of Scotland has had community council areas delineated, the numbers and boundaries of which can be altered by the area council. However not all communities have community councils, which in Scotland are statutory and only exist if local people are willing to stand for election. They are officially stated to be "non-party-political and non-sectarian" in their discussions and decision making. Community councils must adopt a constitution stating the name of the community council and dealing with such matters as the frequency of meetings, office bearers, method of election, finance and standing orders. 
There have been a number of reviews of the role of Community Councils in Scotland, generally emphasising their importance to democratic renewal. One important one was the McIntosh Report on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament
Membership of community councils consists of:
Some Community Councils currently allow: 
Co-opted and ex officio members have no votes on the councils and may not be office bearers.
The establishment scheme will set out the exact procedure for establishing a council where one does not exist: a stated number of local government electors in the designated area must petition the area council, who will then schedule elections. In the case of all community council elections, if nominations are received for less than fifty percent of the seats, the election is postponed and the council not formed or dissolved. Community councils can only be dissolved if the number of elected members falls below the set minimum. Community councils can also choose to amalgamate themselves with an adjoining Community Council by a similar process.
Like in England and Wales, the main role of the CCs is to act as a channel of the opinions of the local community, and have the right to be notified of and respond to any planning applications. They are also sometimes involved in local projects mostly related to local infrastructure such as footpaths, parks, playgrounds etc., and local events.
Unlike in England and Wales, Scottish CCs do not have the right to raise funds by setting a precept on local taxes, and are instead dependent upon local authority funding, which is usually received for running costs only. 
In some areas of Scotland, CCs are often disregarded and are not usually viewed as a tier of government, even though they can legally have that role. Although in places such as <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>, CCs are viewed as an important part of local government, and receive larger budgets.
Until 1974 <a href="Wales">Wales</a> was divided into civil parishes. These were abolished by section 20(6) of the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, and replaced by <a href="Community%20%28Wales%29">communities</a> by section 27 of the same Act. The <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20Wales%23Principal%20areas%20of%20Wales">Principal areas of Wales</a> are divided entirely into communities. Unlike in England, where unparished areas exist, no part of Wales is outside a community, even in urban areas. Not every community has a council, however. 
Community councils in Wales are identical to English parish councils in terms of their powers and the way they operate. Welsh community councils may call themselves town councils unilaterally and may have <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a> granted by <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>. In Wales, all town councils are community councils. There are currently three community councils with city status: <a href="Bangor%2C%20Wales">Bangor</a>, <a href="St%20Asaph">St Asaph</a> and <a href="St%20David%27s">St David's</a>. The community of <a href="Caernarfon">Caernarfon</a> has the status of a royal town. The chair of a town council or city council will usually have the title <a href="Mayors%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">mayor</a>.
In communities with populations too small to justify a full community council, <a href="community%20meeting">community meeting</a>s will be established.

Parliamentary approval for a line from <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> to <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> had been obtained by the <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Sutton%20Railway">Wimbledon and Sutton Railway</a> (W&amp;SR) in 1910 but work had been delayed by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. From the W&amp;SR's inception, the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> (DR) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built.

Guillem de Cabestany

Guillem de Cabestany (; 1162–1212) was a <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalan</a> <a href="troubadour">troubadour</a> from <a href="Cabestany">Cabestany</a> in the <a href="County%20of%20Roussillon">County of Roussillon</a>. He is often known by his <a href="Old%20Occitan">Old Occitan</a> name, Guilhem de Cabestaing, Cabestang, Cabestan, or Cabestanh (pronounced ).
Not much reliable info is known about Guillem de Cabestany. He is probably the son of Arnau de Cabestany, a noble of <a href="County%20of%20Roussillon">Roussillon</a>, probably a vassal in relation with the lords of Castell Rosselló. Cabestany itself is a <a href="fief">fief</a> located immediately next to the east of Castell Rosselló and southwest of <a href="Canet-en-Roussillon">Canet</a> (a future viscounty).
He is said to have been fighting with <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Aragon">Peter II of Aragon</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Las%20Navas%20de%20Tolosa">Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa</a> against the Almohads in 1212.
According to his legendary "<a href="Vida%20%28Occitan%20literary%20form%29">vida</a>", he was the lover of Margarida or Seremonda (or Soremonda), wife of Raimon of Castell Rosselló. On discovering this, Raimon fed Cabestany's heart to Seremonda. When he told her what she had eaten, she threw herself from the window to her death. This legend appears later in <a href="Giovanni%20Boccaccio">Giovanni Boccaccio</a>'s "<a href="Decameron">Decameron</a>" and in the "Cantos" of <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>. It also inspired the opera "<a href="Written%20on%20Skin">Written on Skin</a>" by <a href="George%20Benjamin%20%28composer%29">George Benjamin</a> and <a href="Martin%20Crimp">Martin Crimp</a>, created in 2012. With reference to regional historian Jules Canonge, Cabestany is presented as the archetypal troubador in <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>'s book "Provence".
In reality, Seremonda is known to have been married two or three times, first to Raimon of Castell Rosselló, to another husband in 1210 and next to Aymar de Mosset, who assault fought next to Guillem de Cabestany in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. Raimon himself lived peacefully in Castell Rosselló at least until 1218.

Greenford Branch Line

The Greenford Branch Line is a <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> suburban railway line in west <a href="London">London</a>, England. It runs northerly from a <a href="Wye%20%28rail%29">triangular junction</a> with the <a href="Great%20Western%20Main%20Line">Great Western Main Line</a> west of <a href="West%20Ealing%20railway%20station">West Ealing</a> to a central bay platform at <a href="Greenford%20station">Greenford station</a> which is also on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> <a href="Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29">Central line</a>. A triangular junction near Greenford connects to the <a href="Acton-Northolt%20Line">Acton-Northolt Line</a> (formerly the New North Main Line). The line serves mainly the suburbs of <a href="Ealing">Ealing</a> and <a href="Greenford">Greenford</a>. It is one of the few remaining true branch lines in the Greater London area.
The passenger service is provided by <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Great Western Railway</a>. Trains from the branch continue on the Great Western Main Line to reach <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">Paddington</a>, typically in 24 minutes, and call at the three intermediate stations: West Ealing, <a href="Ealing%20Broadway%20station">Ealing Broadway</a> and .
All services are operated with two-car <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20165">Class 165</a> Turbo diesel trains. There is no Sunday service.
The opening of the line in 1903 coincided with the opening of a station at <a href="Park%20Royal">Park Royal</a> on the Acton-Northolt Line to serve the <a href="Royal%20Show">Royal Agricultural Show</a> held in the grounds of part of the Twyford Abbey Estate. The Show ran from 15 June 1903 to 4 July 1903 during which period trains operated a circular service to and from Paddington via Park Royal and Ealing. Normal services started on 2 May 1904 and the links to Greenford station were put in on 1 October 1904.
The loop formed by the GWML, the branch and the ANL is sometimes used for turning trains for operational reasons such as balancing wheel wear. On weekends in 2008 during engineering works on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a> the line was used by <a href="Virgin%20Trains">Virgin Trains</a>' Euston-Birmingham International "Blockade Buster" service which ran to Euston via Willesden, Acton Main Line, Ealing Broadway, Greenford, High Wycombe, Banbury and Coventry using pairs of 5-car Voyager sets. On two Sundays in February 2010, <a href="Chiltern%20Railways">Chiltern</a> and <a href="Wrexham%20%26amp%3B%20Shropshire">Wrexham &amp; Shropshire</a> trains were diverted to Paddington via the line while engineering work blocked the route to Marylebone.
Locally the service is called the <a href="push-pull%20train">'Push-and-pull'</a>, a term which dates from the days of steam, when the engine could not change ends at Greenford and so the locomotive pulled the carriages one way and pushed them on the return run (see <a href="GWR%20Autocoach">GWR Autocoach</a>). In the 1950s the service frequently ran with two auto-trailers, one either side of the engine.
During the 1960s and '70s the service was normally operated by a 'Bubble Car' two-carriage diesel railcar. NSE later reduced it to a single carriage.
As , and have short platforms only two-car trains can be used.
In 2017 <a href="Crossrail">Crossrail</a> is due to begin using two of the four tracks of the Great Western Main Line and the Greenford service will terminate at West Ealing, rather than continue to Paddington, to obviate interference with Crossrail, and to create track capacity for increased services to Heathrow. In compensation the branch line service will increase from two to four trains per hour. Ealing Council desires to have the line connected to the south west to <a href="Clapham%20Junction">Clapham Junction</a> via the <a href="West%20London%20Line">West London Line</a>, and to the north west to <a href="West%20Ruislip">West Ruislip</a>.
These are statistics of passenger usage on the National Rail network along the Greenford Branch Line from the year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2011.

Deva (composer)

Devanesan Chokkalingam, popularly known as Deva, is an Indian film composer and singer. He has composed songs and provided background music for <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil</a>, <a href="Telugu%20cinema">Telugu</a>, <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> and <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> films in a career spanning about 20 years. Many know his <a href="gaana">gaana</a> songs, written mostly using <a href="Madras%20Tamil">Madras Tamil</a>. He is known as the "Father of Gaana Genre" in the Tamil film industry.
Deva has composed music for many films within a very short period. He debuted as a film music director in the film "Manasukkeththa Maharaasa" in 1989. In the intervening years he has composed music for a total of more than 400 films.
Deva was born to M. C. Chokkalingam and M. C. Krishnaveni. Even in his childhood, Deva was attracted to the world of music. Teaming up with Chandra Bose, he staged many musical programmes. He started learning classical music under Dhanraj and completed a course in Western music at <a href="Trinity%20College%20of%20Music">Trinity College of Music</a> in London. His son <a href="Srikanth%20Deva">Srikanth Deva</a> is also a music director, as are his brothers, who have formed the duo <a href="Sabesh-Murali">Sabesh-Murali</a>. His nephew <a href="Jai%20%28actor%29">Jai</a> is an actor.
Before coming to cinema, Deva worked for some time in the television field. In those days Deva's brothers were working in the musical troupes of <a href="Illayaraja">Illayaraja</a> and other music directors as instrumentalists. But Deva took special interests for self-improvement in his profession and at the same time he was looking for chances to enter movies. But the benefits of those efforts did not bear fruit easily. Only after much hardship he managed to enter the field with the help of some friends and his four brothers. Just after his entry, the production work of those films, for which negotiations were on for fixing Deva as the music director, could not get completed and some other films with his music could not be released at all.
Deva continued his search for an opening, which finally began yielding results in 1989. His first film, "<a href="Manasukketha%20Maharasa">Manasukketha Maharasa</a>", was released in 1989. He was then called to work on the movie "<a href="Vaigasi%20Poranthachu">Vaigasi Poranthachu</a>". This film was a huge hit and Deva was praised for his work. After the release of "Vaikaasi Poranthaachu", his name became known throughout the Tamil community.
So far he has composed music for more than 400 films, which include Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films. He is also famous for his compositions for religious films. He was widely acclaimed for his scores for Rajinikanth starrer "<a href="Basha%20%28film%29">Basha</a>". His other famous compositions include "<a href="Annamalai%20%28film%29">Annamalai</a>" and "<a href="Baashha">Baasha</a>", both starring Super Star Rajnikanth.
Behind Deva's great success, there are his brothers also, which fact he won't deny too! He says: 'If I stand at this height as a music director, the supportive reason behind this is my brothers. They too work hard like me. That's why it was possible for me to accomplish the task of composing music for such huge number of films! So to say, all my 4 brothers have their own share in my present success!'
As a brother Deva showers upon them (brothers) his heart-felt felicitations and his brothers, on their part, continue to take greater pains professionally, to add to the well-meaning achievements of Deva in the future also! This quality of Deva has enhanced his image among the top brass of the cineworld! Hence, veteran music director M.S.Viswanathan has conferred upon Deva the most suitably coined title, "Thenisai Thentral". As if doing full justification to this title, Deva's tunes and musical scores never fail to pour sweet honey in the form of melodious songs into our 'yearning' ears! Among the films whose music was composed by Deva, 7 became silver jubilee hits! 100 days films were 34.
In Kannada, he composed music for many blockbuster films. All the songs in the 1997 super hit film <a href="Amrutha%20Varshini">Amrutha Varshini</a> starring South Actors <a href="Ramesh%20Aravind">Ramesh Aravind</a>, <a href="Suhasini%20Maniratnam">Suhasini Maniratnam</a>, <a href="Sharath%20Babu">Sharath Babu</a> and others is still remembered by the audience. The songs in the film are considered as the evergreen songs in the history of Kannada Cinema and they are the most sung songs in the reality shows even today. Deva has composed songs for many block buster hit films starring South Super Star <a href="Vishnuvardhan%20%28actor%29">Dr. Vishnuvardhan</a>, a star of 220 movies in five different languages. The films Kotigobba, <a href="Simhadriya%20Simha">Simhadriya Simha</a>, Raja Narasimha, Kadamba, Vishnu Sena were all the films in their combination. The songs Kaverige Kaalungura, Sahasa Simha, Annayya Thammayya, Priya Priya, Kalladare Naanu, Barthanavva Bhoopa, Malnad Adike, Pancha Koti Kannadigare, Yamini Yaaramma, Sangathiye, History Gotha written by Kannada Star <a href="Upendra%20%28actor%29">Upendra</a> and all the songs above sung by Indian play back singer Dr.<a href="S.%20P.%20Balasubrahmanyam">S. P. Balasubrahmanyam</a> are super hit songs and still remain as the favourites of the Kannada audience.
He recently made a special appearance in the film "Modhi Vilayadu". On 31 July 2011, Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalitha has made him as the head of the Tamil Nadu Iyal Isai Nadaga Mandram. In 2014, <a href="Anirudh%20Ravichander">Anirudh Ravichander</a> chose Deva to sing a gaana song in his album "<a href="Maan%20Karate">Maan Karate</a>" and labelled Deva as the "father of the <a href="Gaana">Gaana</a> genre".
Veteran music director <a href="M.%20S.%20Viswanathan">M. S. Viswanathan</a> conferred the title Thenisai Thendral upon Deva for his contributions.
In 1990, he received his first <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20State%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Director">Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Music Director</a>. He received the Tamil Nadu Government's <a href="Kalaimamani">Kalaimamani</a> Award in the year 1992. In 1995, the film "[Aasai]" brought him another state film award. For "<a href="Baasha%20%28film%29">Baasha</a>", he got the Tamil Nadu Arts and Cultural Academy Award. Award by Guinness world records for <a href="Sivappu%20Mazhai">Sivappu Mazhai</a> world fastest movie from script to screening. He has also been honoured by awards from popular journals like "<a href="Dinakaran">Dinakaran</a>", "Cinema Express" and "Screen".
One of the major criticisms against Deva is plagiarism. He is known for lifting snippets and sometimes even the full song from famous old and recent English pop songs and using them as his own. Some of the alleged lifts include famous boy band Blue, the song "<a href="Alane%20%28song%29">Alane</a>" by <a href="Wes%20Madiko">Wes</a>, Celine dion, Pakistani band Junoon, English bands Sasha, Linkin Park, The Wonders, Michael Jackson,Dr.Alban, <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>, etc.

Sampson-class destroyer

The "Sampson"-class destroyers served in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. 
Commissioned in 1916 and 1917, the class was a modification of the <a href="O%27Brien%20class%20destroyer">"O'Brien"-class</a> and <a href="Tucker%20class%20destroyer">"Tucker"-class</a>, with the number of 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes increased from four twin-mounts to four triple-mounts. The "Sampson"s were the final six ships of the 26 "thousand tonner" destroyers. They were the largest and most heavily armed of the "thousand tonners", and the subsequent "flush deck" classes differed mainly in hull design and the engineering plant.
While the gun armament was typical for destroyers of this period, the torpedo armament of 12 × 21" torpedo tubes was a significant increase over the preceding <a href="Tucker-class%20destroyer">"Tucker" class</a>, replacing four twin mounts with four triple mounts. Both the gun and torpedo armament would remain standard through the mass-production "flush-deck" <a href="Wickes-class%20destroyer">"Wickes"</a> and <a href="Clemson-class%20destroyer">"Clemson"</a> classes commissioned through 1921. As with the other "thousand tonners", a factor in the size of the torpedo armament was the <a href="General%20Board%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">General Board</a>'s decision to use broadside rather than centerline torpedo tubes. This was due to the desire to have some torpedoes remaining after firing a broadside, and problems experienced with centerline mounts on previous classes with torpedoes striking the <a href="gunwale">gunwale</a>s of the firing ship. The <a href="Mark%208%20torpedo">Mark 8 torpedo</a> was equipped.
This was the first US destroyer class to mount <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> guns: two <a href="1%20pounder">1 pounder</a> (37 mm) <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>s. <a href="Anti-submarine">Anti-submarine</a> (ASW) armament was added during World War I. Typically, a single <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> track was provided aft, along with a <a href="Y-gun">Y-gun</a> depth charge projector.
While the main <a href="steam%20turbine">turbine</a>s were <a href="direct%20drive">direct drive</a>, all of the class were fitted with <a href="gear">gear</a>ed cruising turbines as in the preceding <a href="Tucker-class%20destroyer">"Tucker"s</a>, on one shaft in DD-66-68 and on both shafts in the others.
The "Sampson" class served in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> as convoy escorts in the <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Atlantic</a>. <a href="USS%20Wilkes%20%28DD-67%29">"Wilkes"</a> and <a href="USS%20Shaw%20%28DD-68%29">"Shaw"</a> served in the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> as part of the <a href="Rum%20Patrol">Rum Patrol</a> 1926-34.

Napoleon Opening

The Napoleon Opening is an irregular <a href="chess%20opening">chess opening</a> starting with the moves:
As with the similar <a href="Wayward%20Queen%20Attack">Wayward Queen Attack</a> (2.Qh5), White hopes for the <a href="Scholar%27s%20Mate">Scholar's Mate</a> (2.Qf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5?? 4.Qxf7#), but Black can easily avoid the trap. 
The Napoleon Opening is named after the <a href="France">French</a> general and emperor <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, who had a deep love of chess but was said to be a mediocre player. The name came into use after mid-nineteenth century publications reported that he played this opening in an 1809 game which he lost to <a href="The%20Turk">The Turk</a>, a chess <a href="automaton">automaton</a> operated at the time by <a href="Johann%20Allgaier">Johann Allgaier</a>. The name may also be a slighting reference to Napoleon's empress, <a href="Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais">Josephine</a> and her scandalous infidelities, hence Napoleon's inability to keep his Queen at home.
The Napoleon is a weak opening because it develops the white <a href="queen%20%28chess%29">queen</a> prematurely and subjects it to attack, and deprives the white <a href="kingside">kingside</a> <a href="knight%20%28chess%29">knight</a> of its best development square. By comparison, the Wayward Queen Attack is more forcing and stronger—2.Qh5 requiring Black to first defend his e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), and then after 3.Bc4 forcing Black to play a sub-optimal move (3...g6 virtually committing Black to a <a href="fianchetto">fianchetto</a> rather than a more aggressive placement of the <a href="Bishop%20%28chess%29">bishop</a>; 3...Qe7 blocking the bishop; or 3...Qf6 taking away the knight's best square). 2.Qf3 places no such impediments on Black's development.

27th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)

The 27th Panzer Division began forming in the southern sector of the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28WWII%29">Eastern Front</a> in late 1942, but was never completed due to the loss of its assets during the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> counteroffensives around <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a>, and no further attempts were made to reconstitute the division.
During summer-autumn 1942, part of the division was formed in France, including the division's artillery regiment. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Front, the Brigade Michalik (led by Colonel Helmut Michalik) was formed around the 140th Panzer Grenadier Regiment (which was previously part of <a href="22nd%20Panzer%20Division">22nd Panzer Division</a>).
In Autumn 1942 the two echelons joined in <a href="Voronezh">Voronezh</a>, situated then in the rear area of the <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 2nd Army</a>, and the division was formally activated on 1 October 1942. With about 3,000 men its strength was well under that required for a <a href="Panzer%20Division">Panzer Division</a>; however the situation required that it had to be scattered in several groups to support different sectors of the Eastern Front: Don, south of Kharkov, Hungarian 2nd Army, Italian 8th Army. Twenty tanks were incorporated to the German 2nd Army Headquarters. The 127th Pz.Eng.Batt. never joined the rest of the Division, as it was one of the units encircled at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a>, where it was destroyed.
This activity took a heavy toll on the division's strength: by 1 January 1943, it had only half of its panzergrenadiers and 11 tanks; and the estimated total strength by 8 February was less than 1,600 men. Once the <a href="Operation%20Little%20Saturn">Soviet winter offensive</a> was stopped, the 27th Panzer was disbanded around 3 March 1943. The survivors of the 127th Panzer and 127th Panzer Signals Battalions were assigned to the <a href="24th%20Panzer%20Division">24th Panzer Division</a> in France, while the remainder men and materiel were incorporated into the <a href="7th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Panzer Division</a> in Russia.

Competitive eating

Competitive eating, or speed eating, is a <a href="sport">sport</a> in which participants compete against each other to consume large quantities of food in a short time period. Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long, although some competitions can last up to thirty minutes, with the person consuming the most food being declared the winner. Competitive eating is most popular in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes, including cash.
Traditionally, eating contests, often involving pies, were events at <a href="county%20fair">county fair</a>s. The recent surge in the popularity of competitive eating is due in large part to the development of the <a href="Nathan%27s%20Hot%20Dog%20Eating%20Contest">Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest</a>, an annual holiday tradition that has been held on July 4 virtually every year since the 1970s at <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a>. In 2001, <a href="Takeru%20Kobayashi">Takeru Kobayashi</a> transformed the competition and the world of competitive eating by downing 50 hot dogs – smashing the previous record (25.5). The event generates enormous media attention and has been aired on ESPN for the past eight years, contributing to the growth of the competitive eating phenomenon. Takeru Kobayashi won it consistently from 2001 through 2006. He was dethroned in 2007 by <a href="Joey%20Chestnut">Joey Chestnut</a>. In 2008, Chestnut and Kobayashi tied at 59 hot dogs in 10 minutes (the time span had previously been 12 minutes), and Chestnut won in an eatoff in which he was the first of the two competitors to finish eating 5 hot dogs in overtime, earning Chestnut his second consecutive title. Chestnut holds the world record of 69 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. Kobayashi holds six Guinness Records, for eating hot dogs, meatballs, Twinkies, hamburgers, and pizza. He competed in hot dog contests in 2011 and 2012 and claimed to have eaten 68 and 69. Kobayashi goes on to say that he completed this by drinking lots and lots of liquid for a few days before the event before not eating anything all day on the event.
<a href="http%3A//www.CompetitiveEaters.com">All Pro Eating</a> is the only Independent Competitive Eating organization in the world and also officially sanctions competitive eating contests.
All Pro Eating differs from the IFOCE with its adherence to "picnic style" competitive eating rules in addition to being the most recognized competitive eating organization that allows independent competitive eaters to participate (independent competitive eaters are not under any contractual obligation). Picnic style rules pay "respect to the food and maintains the integrity and dignity and public reputation of that food item." Under these rules, the league forbids the dunking of any contest foods in water, a practice used by almost every IFOCE eater at IFOCE events, and one believed to speed the chewing and swallowing process. All Pro Eating Promotions is the only competitive eating organization that provides sanctioned independent competitive eating events that specifically follow picnic style rules.
Recognized All Pro Eating Competitive Eaters include <a href="Molly%20Schuyler">Molly Schuyler</a>, Eric "Silo" Dahl, Jamie "The Bear" McDonald and Stephanie "Xanadu" Torres.
All Pro Eating has been significantly featured in American and International media including a strong connection with television projects produced by TV Tokyo.
In 2010, All Pro Eating was joined by new eaters including former IFOCE members "Jammin" <a href="Joe%20LaRue">Joe LaRue</a>, Chris "The Mad Greek" Abatsas and newcomer "Munchin" Mike Longo.
The year started off with the USquare National Eating Championship in Madison Wisconsin. Ian The Invader Hickman won with 102 ounces of food court food in 8 minutes.
On June 5 in Rockville Centre, NY "Munchin" Mike Longo won the National Cheese Steak Eating Championship with 4.05 cheese steaks eating in 7 minutes.
"Munchin" Mike Longo also won the Little Jimmy's National Italian Ice Eating Championship again beating AICE eating star Ian The Invader Hickman and legendary eater King George Van Laar, eating 4 lbs 1.25 ounces of Italian ice in 7 minutes.
In Middlebury. Connecticut The Caribbean Food Eating Championship took place where Joel The Cannon Podelsky won the National Bun and Cheese National Championship eating 40 ounces in 4 min and 43 sec. King George Van Laar won the National Beef Pattie Eating Championship eating 60oz of beef patties in 7 minutes 32 sec.
5th Annual American Meatball Eating Championship took place in Midlothian, Illinois. Bob “KILLER” Kuhns of Pittsburgh, PA took 1st with 36.5 meatballs in 7 minutes to win $1,000.
The <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Competitive%20Eating">International Federation of Competitive Eating</a> (IFOCE) hosts nearly 50 "Major League Eating" events across North America every year. The IFOCE, which first established eating in the 1990s, developing the Nathan's Famous contest and eating circuit, recently launched <a href="Major%20League%20Eating">Major League Eating</a> to serve as an umbrella for competitive eating while also providing a recognized brand for licensing of T-shirts and other products. It features videos of contests and eaters and offers a complete and official records. Among the top eaters who compete only in Major League Eating events are Joey Chestnut, Sonya Thomas, Eater X, Notorious B.O.B., Badlands Booker, Matt Stonie, Miki Sudo and Crazy Legs Conti. MLE developed and conducts nearly all of the major eating events, including the Acme Oyster-Eating Contest, the National Buffalo Wing Contest, The Hooters World Wing-Eating Championship, among many others.
IFOCE has produced a three-hour elimination tournament on ESPN called the <a href="Alka-Seltzer">Alka-Seltzer</a> U.S. Open of Competitive Eating, plus additional hours of ESPN programming on eating for Johnsonville Brats and Krystal hamburgers. The IFOCE also produced a series of 30-minute television shows, "Eats of Strength," for high-definition network InHD. Spike TV also ran a series of one-hour Major League Eating events, featuring the top eaters of the IFOCE, and the IFOCE produced a one-hour docudrama on the Acme World Oyster Eating Contest in New Orleans.
Other eating contests sponsored by restaurants can involve a challenge to eat large or extraordinarily spicy food items, including giant <a href="steak">steak</a>s, <a href="hamburger">hamburger</a>s and <a href="curries">curries</a> in a set amount of time. Those who finish the item are often rewarded by not having to pay for the item, or with a T-shirt and the addition of their name and/or photo on a wall of challenge victors. Various challenges of this type are featured in the <a href="Travel%20Channel">Travel Channel</a> show "<a href="Man%20v.%20Food">Man v. Food</a>".
The type of food used in contests varies greatly, with each contest typically only using one type of food (e.g. a hot dog eating contest). Foods used in professional eating contests include <a href="hamburger">hamburger</a>s, <a href="hot%20dog">hot dog</a>s, <a href="pie">pie</a>s, <a href="pancake">pancake</a>s, <a href="Buffalo%20wing">chicken wings</a>, <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a>, <a href="pizza">pizza</a>, <a href="ribs%20%28food%29">ribs</a>, whole <a href="Domesticated%20turkey%23Turkeys%20as%20food">turkey</a>s, among many other types of food. There is also a <a href="Veganism">vegan</a> hot dog eating competition held in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.
Competitive eating contests often adhere to an 8, 10, 12 or 15 minute time limit. Most contests are presided over by a <a href="master%20of%20ceremonies">master of ceremonies</a>, whose job is to announce the competitors prior to the contest and keep the audience engaged throughout the contest with enthusiastic play-by-play commentary and amusing anecdotes. A countdown from 10 usually takes place at the end of the contest, with all eating coming to an end with the expiration of time.
Many professional contests also employ a series of <a href="judge">judge</a>s, whose role is to enforce the contest rules and warn eaters about infractions. Judges will also be called upon to count or weigh each competitor's food and certify the results of the contest prior to the winner being announced.
Many eaters will attempt to put as much food in their mouths as possible during the final seconds of a contest, a practice known by professionals as "chipmunking." If chipmunking is allowed in a contest, eaters are given a reasonable amount of time (typically less than two minutes) to swallow the food or risk a deduction from their final totals.
In many contests, except those adhering to "picnic style rules" mentioned previously, eaters are allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow. Dunking typically takes place with foods involving a bun or other doughy parts. Professional contests often enforce a limit on the amount of time competitors are allowed to dunk food.
Competitors are expected to maintain a relatively clean eating surface throughout the contest. Excess debris after the contest may result in a deduction from the eater's final totals.
If, at any point during or immediately after the contest, a competitor <a href="Regurgitation%20%28digestion%29">regurgitates</a> any food, he or she will be disqualified. Vomiting, also known as a "reversal", or, as ESPN and the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest call it, a "reversal of fortune", includes obvious signs of vomiting as well as any small amounts of food that may fall from the mouth deemed by judges to have come from the stomach. Small amounts of food already in the mouth prior to swallowing are excluded from this rule.
Many professional competitive eaters undergo rigorous personal training in order to increase their stomach capacity and eating speed with various foods. Stomach elasticity is usually considered the key to eating success, and competitors commonly train by drinking large amounts of water over a short time to stretch out the stomach. Others combine the consumption of water with large quantities of low calorie foods such as vegetables or salads. Some eaters chew large amounts of gum in order to build jaw strength.
For a marquee event like the <a href="Nathan%27s%20Hot%20Dog%20Eating%20Contest">Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest</a>, some eaters, like former contest champion <a href="Joey%20Chestnut">Joey Chestnut</a>, will begin training several months before the event with personal time trials using the contest food. Retired competitive eater Ed "Cookie" Jarvis trained by consuming entire heads of boiled cabbage followed by drinking up to two gallons of water every day for two weeks before a contest. Due to the risks involved with training alone or without emergency medical supervision, the IFOCE actively discourages training of any sort.
The chief criticism of competitive eating is the message the <a href="gluttony">gluttonous</a> sport sends as <a href="obesity">obesity</a> levels rise among Americans and the example it sets for youth.
Others, like actor <a href="Ryan%20Reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a> in an editorial on <a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>, contend that competitive eating is yet another example of Western gluttony at a time when so many others around the world are starving. In the same article, retired competitive eater Don "Moses" Lerman foreshadows the dangers of competitive eating when he admits "I'll stretch my stomach until it causes <a href="internal%20bleeding">internal bleeding</a>."
The argument that competitive eating can cause weight gain, which may lead to <a href="obesity">obesity</a> and elevated <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> and <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> is common. The potential damage that competitive eating can cause to the human digestive system was the subject of a 2007 study by the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine</a>. The study observed professional eater <a href="Tim%20Janus">Tim Janus</a>, who ate 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes before doctors intervened. It was concluded that through training, Janus' stomach failed to have normal muscle contractions called <a href="peristalsis">peristalsis</a>, a function which transfers food from the stomach down the digestive tract.
Other medical professionals contend that <a href="binge%20eating">binge eating</a> can cause stomach perforations in those with <a href="Peptic%20ulcer">ulcers</a> and gulping large quantities of water during training can lead to <a href="water%20intoxication">water intoxication</a>, a condition which dilutes <a href="electrolytes">electrolytes</a> in the <a href="blood">blood</a>. <a href="Gastroparesis">Gastroparesis</a>, also known as stomach paralysis, is also a concern among those who routinely stretch their stomachs beyond capacity. The condition may lead to the stomach's inability to contract and lose its ability to empty itself. Side effects of gastroparesis include chronic <a href="indigestion">indigestion</a>, nausea and vomiting.
In October 2012, a 32-year-old man died while competitively eating live <a href="Cockroach">roaches</a> and <a href="worm">worm</a>s in a contest to win a <a href="ball%20python">ball python</a>. An autopsy revealed he choked to death. On July 4, 2014, a 47-year-old competitive eater similarly choked to death during a hot dog eating contest.

From the summit there are views into Germany and Poland. The <a href="Horn%C3%AD%20Hanychov">Horní Hanychov</a> region of Liberec lies just below the mountain.
On the summit is the <a href="Je%C5%A1t%C4%9Bd%20Tower">Ještěd Tower</a> restaurant, hotel and television tower, designed by <a href="Karel%20Hub%C3%A1%C4%8Dek">Karel Hubáček</a>, accessible by road or cable car (<a href="Je%C5%A1t%C4%9Bd%20Cable%20car">Ještěd Cable car</a>). The mountain also has a <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a>.
The origin of the mountain's name is uncertain, it is probably from the term <a href="Fraxinus">Ash</a> mountain, a once dominant tree species in the area. The Czech name for the mountain was first recorded in 1545 as "Jesstied" (pod horou Jesstiedem). The German form of the name, Jeschke, was first mentioned in 1565.
As far back as 1838 the summit hosted a crude stone that serves as a landmark to this day. The first hut on the summit was erected as early as 1844.
In the 1860s, the mountain ridge was Station No. 4 of the first order of the <a href="Royal%20Saxon%20triangulation">Royal Saxon triangulation</a>. For this reason a measuring station was built on the summit.
In 1906, the Mountain Club, a mountain hotel, was built. The Jeschke Horní Hanychov cable car to the summit was opened in 1933.

The old mountain hotel burned down in 1963.
Between 1966 and 1973, a futuristic hotel, with a 100-metre-high television tower, was built that was designed by the architect, <a href="Karel%20Hubacek">Karel Hubacek</a>. For the construction of the TV tower, Hubacek was awarded the Auguste Perret Prize. The modern building acts as a lookout tower, transmission tower, hotel and restaurant.

22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)

The 22nd Infantry Division was a German infantry division in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.
Created as 22.

Though planned for use in its air-landing role for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a>, it was replaced by another division at the last minute. It joined Army Group South in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> (1941), attacking from <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and, operating exclusively as ordinary ground infantry, helped storm <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281942%29">Sevastopol</a> in the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a> (1942).

Francisco Carrascón

Don Francisco Carrascón (ca. 1710 – ca.1780), also known as Don Francesco <a href="Carascon">Carascon</a>, was a high ranking <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> Military Officer and War Commissioner in the 18th Century. He was born in Zaragoza but ancestrally he was descended from the House of Carrascon of <a href="%C3%81greda">Ágreda</a> (<a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a>), <a href="Cintruenigo">Cintruenigo</a> (Navarra) and <a href="Tudela%2C%20Navarre">Tudela</a> (Navarra). The founder of the Spanish House was Doctor Don Garcia Fernandez de Carrascón (ca 1480-1533), a wealthy Spanish cleric from Ágreda, Spain who was a protonotary apostolic and personal doctor to Pope Adrian VI as well as a canon of the Cathedral of Toledo, Spain. He left his fortune in the form of a mayorazgo or family trust to his nephew Don Pedro Carrascon and his descendents. Doctor Carrascon is buried in an elaborate chapel in the Church of San Miguel Arcangel in Ágreda. The Carrascon were recognized as having <a href="Hidalgo%20%28Spanish%20nobility%29">Hidalgo</a> or noble status in the mid 17th Century, but were noble going back to at least the 15th Century. 
Don Francisco served as War Commissioner (Comisario de Guerra) in <a href="Orbetello">Orbetello</a> in 1737–1739 just after the <a href="War%20of%20Polish%20Succession">War of Polish Succession</a>, and in <a href="Messina">Messina</a> from 1740 to 1750. He was a close associate of the founder of the <a href="Passionist">Passionist</a> Order, St. <a href="Paul%20of%20the%20Cross">Paul of the Cross</a> and he is mentioned frequently in his letters from the era. Don Francisco was appointed <a href="Senator">Senator</a> of <a href="Messina">Messina</a> in 1751 under the <a href="Viceroy%20of%20Sicily">Viceroy of Sicily</a>, <a href="Don%20Eustachio%2C%20Duke%20of%20Laviefuille">Don Eustachio, Duke of Laviefuille</a>. After a few decades on the Italian peninsula, he and his descendants became known by the italianized spelling of the surname <a href="Carascon">Carascon</a>.
Don Francisco was married to Donna Rosa Diez, believed to be the sister of Don Antonio Filareto Diez e Palmero, a Sicilian Nobleman and Senator of Palermo in 1745 and 1764. Don Franciso and Donna Rosa had two sons and four daughters. His eldest son, Don Bernabe (or Barnaba) Carrascon was a Colonel in command of the Provincial Regiments of the Kingdom of Naples, and later Commandant of Lucera. His second son, Don Antonio Carrascon, was a Lieutenant Colonel and Governor of the Fortress of Vieste on the Adriatic Sea. Of the daughters, Donna Maria Giuseppa Carascon married Don Berlingiero Scoppa of Lucera, Donna Marianna Carascon married Don Orsino Scoppa of Lucera, Donna Berardina Carrascon married into the noble D'Espinosa Family and was godmother to General Don Gabriele Manthoné, a leader of the 1799 Naples revolution. One other daughter of unknown name married Cavaliere Gaetano Pistorio of Messina.

King's Pawn Game

The King's Pawn Game is any <a href="chess%20opening">chess opening</a> starting with the move:
It is among the most popular opening moves in <a href="chess">chess</a>.
White opens with the most popular of the twenty possible opening moves. Although effective in winning for White (54.25%), it is not quite as successful as the four next most common openings for White: 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%). Since nearly all openings beginning 1.e4 have names of their own, the term "King's Pawn Game", unlike <a href="Queen%27s%20Pawn%20Game">Queen's Pawn Game</a>, is rarely used to describe the opening of the game.
Advancing the king's pawn two squares is highly useful because it occupies a <a href="center%20%28chess%29">center</a> square, attacks the center square d5, and allows the development of White's <a href="king%20%28chess%29">king's</a> <a href="bishop%20%28chess%29">bishop</a> and <a href="queen%20%28chess%29">queen</a>. Chess legend <a href="Bobby%20Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> said that the King's Pawn Game is "Best by test."
King's Pawn Games are further classified by whether Black responds with or not. Openings beginning with are called Double King's Pawn Games (or Openings), Symmetrical King's Pawn Games (or Openings), or <a href="Open%20Games">Open Games</a> – these terms are equivalent. Openings where Black responds to with a move other than are called Asymmetrical King's Pawn Games or <a href="Semi-Open%20Game">Semi-Open Game</a>s.
The "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Chess%20Openings">Encyclopedia of Chess Openings</a>" (ECO) classifies all King's Pawn Games into volumes B or C: volume C if the game starts with (the <a href="French%20Defence">French Defence</a>) or ; volume B if Black answers with any other move.
The rare instances where the opening does not fall into a more specific category than "King's Pawn Game" are included in codes B00 (includes the <a href="Nimzowitsch%20Defence">Nimzowitsch Defence</a> and unusual moves after 1.e4), C20 (includes <a href="Alapin%27s%20Opening">Alapin's Opening</a> and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5), C40 (includes the <a href="Latvian%20Gambit">Latvian Gambit</a> and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3), and C50 (includes the <a href="Hungarian%20Defence">Hungarian Defence</a>, the <a href="Giuoco%20Pianissimo">Giuoco Pianissimo</a>, and unusual moves after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4).
The Black responses which are given one or more chapters in the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Chess%20Openings">Encyclopedia of Chess Openings</a>" (ECO) are given below, ranked in order of popularity according to <a href="ChessBase">ChessBase</a>.
Apart from these eight responses, all other replies from Black are covered together in ECO chapter B00 ("Uncommon King's Pawn Opening"). A few of these are not entirely obscure, and have received extensive analysis.
The remaining replies to 1.e4 are very rare, and have not received significant and serious attention by masters. MCO does not cover them, considering them so bad as not to merit discussion. These openings sometimes lead to wild and exciting games, and are occasionally employed by weaker players to get better trained opponents "out-of-book". Some have exotic names, they are listed below along with instances where they have been used by strong players.

Mr. Bungle is the eponymous debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American band <a href="Mr.%20Bungle">Mr. Bungle</a>. It was released on August 13, 1991, through <a href="Warner%20Music%20Group">Warner Bros. Records</a>. The album contains many genre shifts which are typical of the band, and helped increase the band's popularity, gaining them a reasonable following and fanbase. The fact that <a href="Mike%20Patton">Mike Patton</a> was gaining fame from <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a> may also have been a contributing factor to this. The album cover features artwork by Dan Sweetman, originally published in the story, "A Cotton Candy Autopsy" in the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>/<a href="Piranha%20Press">Piranha Press</a> imprint title, "<a href="Beautiful%20Stories%20for%20Ugly%20Children">Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children</a>".
The first track, "<a href="Travolta%20%28song%29">Quote Unquote</a>", was originally titled "<a href="Travolta%20%28song%29">Travolta</a>", referring to <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a>, but had to be changed for legal reasons. However, Travolta's name is still spoken in the song. The first few minutes of the "Lunchroom Manners" instructional video, where the band got its name, can be heard at the end of "Love is a Fist". 
<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called the album a "dizzying, disconcerting, schizophrenic tour through just about any rock style the group can think of, hopping from genre to genre without any apparent rhyme or reason, and sometimes doing so several times in the same song." The website described <a href="Mike%20Patton">Mike Patton</a>'s lyrics as "even more bizarrely humorous than those he used in <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a>", and "also less self-censored".
Quotes from <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>'s 1986 film "<a href="Blue%20Velvet%20%28film%29">Blue Velvet</a>" are strewn throughout the album. <a href="digital%20audio%20sample">Samples</a> included are outtakes from <a href="KFC">KFC</a> commercials, items from the videogames "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>", "<a href="Altered%20Beast">Altered Beast</a>", "<a href="Smash%20TV">Smash TV</a>" and "<a href="R.B.I.%20Baseball">R.B.I. Baseball</a>", the <a href="pornography">pornographic</a> film "Raw Footage" (misattributed to "Sharon's Sex Party") and the pinball games "Cyclone", "Earthshaker" and "Haunted House".
The album was generally well received by critics upon release, with "<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>" writing, "It's a difficult, not very accessible record, and the band wouldn't have it any other way" and awarding the album four and a half of a possible five stars.
"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", however, gave the album a much more negative review, writing, "Adjectives like puerile and unlistenable take on entirely new dimensions when applied to "Mr. Bungle"".

Berridale, New South Wales

Berridale is a small town of 844 people in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, and is the administrative centre of the <a href="Snowy%20River%20Shire">Snowy River Shire</a>, one of Australia's major inland tourism destinations. Berridale lies at 860 metres above sea level between the towns of <a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a> and <a href="Jindabyne%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Jindabyne</a> and 435 kilometres south of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>.
Berridale has a definite four seasons: with potential snow during winter despite being below the snowline and temperatures reaching sweltering 40 degrees Celsius in the summer months of December to February. During summer, the average temperature ranges from a minimum 9° Celsius to a maximum of 28°. During the wintertime, the minimum temperature can go below −5° while the maximum temperature can rise as high as 16°. Berridale's climate is relatively dry as the town is located in a rainshadow on the <a href="Monaro%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Monaro</a> between the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains">Snowy Mountains</a> and the coastal zone.
The land surrounding the town is a combination of cleared farmland and lightly wooded bush. There are granite boulders located south through west of the town on the roads to both <a href="Jindabyne%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Jindabyne</a> and <a href="Dalgety%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dalgety</a>. This granite was crystallised as a large mass from magma 400 million years ago miles from the Earth's surface and was gradually eroded and uplifted to its current position. The hills immediately to the north of the town have less granite. There are, however, a few small areas of shale.
Aborigines long occupied the area but in small numbers. The European settlement was founded in the 1860s, when Scotsman William Oliver built his house there in 1863 and opened a roadside store, naming the location as a variation on his home town in Scotland, <a href="Berriedale%2C%20Highland">Berriedale</a>. The dry climate later proved the town ideal for growing fine merino wool. Oliver's store became a wayside inn in 1870, which still exists as the Berridale Inn, and a granite store was built. A post office opened in the town in 1869 with a telegraph office opening in 1870.
The town nicknamed itself the 'Crossroads of the Snowy' during the period when gold miners would pass through on their way to the <a href="Adaminaby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Adaminaby</a> and <a href="Kiandra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kiandra</a> goldfields. Berridale was also nicknamed the 'Town of the Poplars' in the 1990s due to the main road through it from Cooma to Jindabyne (Jindabyne Road/Kosciusko Road ) being lined by an avenue of poplars. The town grew slowly with the pastoral industry forming the mainstay of the local economy. The town hosted a work camp for the <a href="Snowy%20Hydro%20Limited">Snowy Mountains Authority</a> although its population did not grow as much as Jindabyne or Cooma during the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains%20Scheme">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a>.
Berridale is also home to one of the largest collections of heavy machinery and associated equipment salvaged from construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The items include dozers, graders, scrapers, dumpers, loaders, tournapulls, trucks, snow equipment and numerous other pieces, from well known makers such as International, Euclid, LeTourneau Westinghouse, Allis Chalmers, Caterpillar, Thornycroft, Leyland, and others and numbers in excess of 100 pieces. A museum is planned for future construction to display the items.
In recent decades, Berridale has developed a tourism industry based on its location en route to the NSW snow fields. <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> was staying in Berridale in September 1985 on a family ski holiday when <a href="Andrew%20Peacock">Andrew Peacock</a> announced that he would call a Party Room meeting to replace him as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. When Howard was re-elected as Deputy Leader on 5 September, Peacock was in an untenable position and resigned with Howard becoming leader of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition.
Berridale Public School is a primary school with around 100 pupils, serving the town and the outlying areas, with pupils going on to the Snowy Mountains Grammar School or Jindabyne Central School in Jindabyne or Monaro High School in Cooma.
With its moonlike landscape, Berridale is a haven for photographers during each season. Many photographers utilise the granite boulders for shots whilst many will also take advantage of the Poplar trees that line the highway when they change from bright green to a lumious yellow during autumn.
During the year the Lions Club hold the Easter and Spring markets which draw a large crowd to the township. The Berridale Chamber of Commerce also holds a Christmas Twilight Market which proves to be very popular.
The Heritage Walk is also popular with tourists and residents. The walk features many of the older parts of the town.
Berridale also plays host to being a checkpoint during The Snowy Ride. The Snowy Ride is a motorcycle event run annually in the Alpine Region of NSW with the aim of involving motorcycle riders from all over Australia to raise money for Childhood Cancer Research.
During Winter, Berridale's population swells as skiers and seasonal workers converge on the town as they make it their base for the winter ski season.
Berridale has tennis court facilities, four of which are all weather and two clay and are used weekly during the warmer months.
Berridale also competes in the Monaro and District Cricket Association fielding one side in the competition and have won several competitions in the past.
The Berridale swimming pool is open from November until March.
Golf is played at the Coolamatong Golf Club which is located around 2 km from the CBD. The course is 18 holes and features grass greens and is also used for the Diggers Golf Day held in May each year. The club house is located in the CBD.
Berridale is also used as a training base for cyclists from all over Australia who use the many roads to train on as well as taking advantage of the high altitude.
On 28 March 1942, a <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">USAAF</a> <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40E</a> fighter made an emergency landing at "Wheat Hill" station, after becoming lost in fog during a flight from <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. The pilot, Lt Chester Namola stayed overnight with the headmaster of the local public school.

Middle East Command

The Middle East Command, later Middle East Land Forces, was a <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> Command established prior to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Its primary role was to command <a href="British%20Army">British land forces</a> and co-ordinate with the relevant naval and air commands to defend British interests in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and eastern Mediterranean region.
During the Second World War Middle East Command supervised military operations in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Desert, East Africa, Greece and the Middle East</a>. Following the defeat of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis forces</a> in the Western Desert at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</a> and the landing of additional Anglo-American forces during <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, it transferred control of land forces to the newly created <a href="Allied%20Force%20Headquarters">Allied Forces Headquarters</a>.
Middle East Command was established in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, during June 1939, due to the rising tensions in Europe. Its purpose was to provide a centralised command structure in times of war for the three separate army commands based within the Mediterranean and Middle East areas: <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20Sudan">Sudan</a> and <a href="British%20Mandate%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a>/<a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Transjordan</a>. During periods of peace the command exerted authority over land forces based within Egypt, the Sudan, Palestine, Transjordan, and <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. However, if war broke out, the Command's area of responsibility would be extended to include <a href="British%20Somaliland">British Somaliland</a>, <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and the shores of the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. As the war progressed, Middle East Command authority was extended over further areas including <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="Libya">Libya</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. <a href="Lieutenant-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> Sir <a href="Archibald%20Percival%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>, commanding officer of Southern Command in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, was chosen as the first <a href="General%20Officer%20Commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> in Chief, a position he took up in July 1939, and was given the <a href="Acting%20%28rank%29">acting rank</a> of <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a>.
The <a href="Committee%20of%20Imperial%20Defence">Committee of Imperial Defence</a>, when establishing the post of General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East Command, made the decision that all three services should be responsible for the defence of the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. As Middle East Command wielded authority only over land forces, a <a href="triumvirate">triumvirate</a> was established to form the High Command. The two other members of this arrangement were the Naval Commander-in-Chief, <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean</a>, Admiral Sir <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a> and <a href="Air%20Officer">Air Officer</a> Commanding-in-Chief, <a href="RAF%20Middle%20East%20Command">RAF Middle East Command</a>, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Longmore">Arthur Longmore</a>. The Naval Commander-in-Chief, <a href="East%20Indies%20Station">East Indies Station</a> would stand in for the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, in the latter's absence.
Wavell had suggested that due to the complex and uncertain situation in the Middle East region, following the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">collapse of France</a>, that a committee, under a Cabinet Minister, should be established in the Middle East region to perform duties delegated to it by the Home Office, thus relieving the need to constantly refer to the War Cabinet for instructions. An alternative suggestion, however, was accepted: a ministerial committee would be established in London with the task of continually keeping the affairs of the Middle East region under review. On 28 June 1941, a position—similar to the original request put forward by Wavell—was established when <a href="Oliver%20Lyttelton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Chandos">Oliver Lyttelton</a> was appointed to the position of Minister of State in the Middle East and dispatched to the Middle East. His role was to provide the three commanders-in-chief the political guidance they needed, advice on propaganda, subversive warfare, finance and economic warfare.
Middle East Command, upon it establishment, was to also co-ordinate with the French military in the Middle East and Africa. The command was also authorised to liaise with the <a href="Turkish%20General%20Staff">Turkish General Staff</a> and possibly, at a later date, the Greek General Staff.
On 30 August 1939 Middle East Command received instructions stating that if they received a formal telegram informing them that a state of war existed between the United Kingdom and Italy, that all defensive measures taken against the Italians should be as non-provocative as possible. Following the start of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> in September and the quick <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">defeat of Poland</a> in September 1939, the threat of an <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> attack from the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> against British positions in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean region became a serious possibility. On 19 October 1939, the "Treaty of Mutual Assistance" was signed between the United Kingdom, France and <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>; <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Archibald%20Wavell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a> signed on behalf of the United Kingdom. Following the signing of this treaty, the Middle East Command, as well as the representatives of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, were authorised to begin discussions with the Turkish general staff, and a further conference was held during March 1940.
At the same time Wavell ordered his subordinate commanders to start planning operations on the assumption that the United Kingdom would soon be at war with Italy. Lieutenant-General <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a>, commander of British forces in Egypt, was to plan for the capture of <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> and <a href="Jaghbub%2C%20Libya">Jaghbub</a> (<a href="Libya">Libya</a>) and to examine the possibility of using <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>. Wilson was also to make preparations within Egypt to receive an additional six divisions. Lieutenant-General <a href="Michael%20Barker%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Barker</a> was ordered to estimate the minimum requirements for the internal security of the <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British mandate of Palestine</a>, not to consider an attack on Palestine from the north a serious threat, and be prepared to reinforce the <a href="Iraqi%20Army">Iraqi Army</a>. The commanding officers in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> and the <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> were given the task of reviewing operations for the purpose of destroying and dispersing Italian forces and support local risings all in support of the main Allied offensive, which was planned to be launched from <a href="French%20Somaliland">French Somaliland</a>. General <a href="William%20Platt">Platt</a>, commanding British forces in the Sudan, was also asked to consider launching an operation against <a href="Kufra">Kufra</a> (southern Libya). Following October 1939, as the Italians had made no aggressive moves, the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Armoured Division</a> and other units were withdrawn from the frontline area, while training and exercises were conducted in the desert.
On 15 February 1940, the position of General Officer Commanding in Chief, Middle East was renamed to Commander-in-Chief Middle East. The new title received some criticism on the grounds that command in the Middle East was a joint venture between all three services. As the head of Middle East Command held authority only over ground forces the criticism was expressed that the name should have been Army or Land Commander-in-Chief.
For the first nine months of the Second World War, the <a href="Middle%20East%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle Eastern theatre</a> was quiet. This was until Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940 and the start of the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">East African Campaign</a>. However, in spite of his inferiority in troop numbers, Wavell was able to not only defend against the Italian attacks but by May 1941, he was able to defeat the Italians and occupy <a href="Italian%20East%20Africa">their east African colonies</a> of <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="Italian%20Somaliland">Italian Somaliland</a>.
When tensions increased in Iraq, Wavell—in agreement with the <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20India">Commander-in-Chief, India</a>—on 9 March 1941 suggested to the Chiefs of Staff that, if fighting was to occur in the country, it should be conducted under <a href="India%20Command">India Command</a>.
In the meantime, Wavell had sent a force to <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> to suppress a <a href="coup%20d%27etat">coup d'etat</a> by elements sympathetic to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. In June 1941, he ordered the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20campaign">invasion and occupation of Syria and Lebanon</a> to prevent further potential support of Iraq by the Germans through these <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a>-controlled areas. In July he ordered <a href="Iraqforce">Iraqforce</a> to <a href="Anglo-Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Iran">Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran</a> in cooperation with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> forces from the north to safeguard the oilfields. Iran and Iraq were transferred out of the Middle East Command into a separate <a href="Persia%20and%20Iraq%20Command">Persia and Iraq Command</a> in August 1942.
In the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert</a>, by February 1941, the British had appeared to be on the verge of overrunning the last Italian forces in <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. This would have ended Axis control in all of Africa. Then the tide of war turned against the British as the Germans <a href="Balkans%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">attacked through the Balkans</a> and continued on to occupy <a href="Crete">Crete</a>. The Germans reinforced the Italians in Libya with the <a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>, under <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, and the British suffered further setbacks. Wavell and Auchinleck exchanged positions, <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a> becoming C-in-C Middle East and Wavell becoming <a href="Commander-in-Chief%20in%20India">C-in-C in India</a>.
While Auchinleck was in command, the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Eighth Army</a> confronting the German Afrika Korps and the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italian Army</a> was commanded successively by General Sir <a href="Alan%20Cunningham">Alan Cunningham</a> and Lieutenant-General <a href="Neil%20Ritchie">Neil Ritchie</a>. Ritchie was dismissed after defeats at the hands of Rommel. Auchinleck assumed the field command himself and the Italo-German advance was halted the at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>. The "Auk," as he was known to his troops, struggled with the innate conservatism of the army establishment to get the armoured and infantry wings of the army to fight together on the German pattern, but had only limited success.
Like his opponent Rommel (and his predecessor Wavell), Auchinleck was subjected to constant political interference. He received a series of hectoring telegrams and instructions from <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> throughout late 1941 and early 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck. Disappointed with the military reverses in Egypt and <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, he was desperate for some sort of British victory before the planned Anglo-American landings in North Africa (<a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation "Torch"</a>) scheduled for November 1942. In August 1942, immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after First Alamein, Churchill flew to Cairo, purportedly for consultations with Auchinleck, but had in fact made up his mind before he left Britain. Auchinleck was sacked by Churchill, almost certainly because he refused to be bullied by Churchill into ordering a major offensive before he and his troops were properly prepared. He was replaced as C-in-C Middle East by <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a> and as <a href="General%20officer%20commanding">GOC</a> Eighth Army by Lieutenant-General <a href="William%20Gott">William Gott</a>, who was killed in Egypt before taking up command. On Gott's death, Lieutenant-General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> was appointed commander of the Eighth Army. Auchinleck was offered the command of a newly created <a href="Persia%20and%20Iraq%20Command">Persia and Iraq Command</a> which was being split out from Middle East Command but felt unable to accept the appointment, which was then taken by General <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Sir Henry Maitland Wilson</a>.
Alexander presided over Montgomery's victory at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. After the Anglo-American forces from <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a> and the Western Desert forces met in the <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">Tunisia Campaign</a> in January 1943, he became deputy to <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> in <a href="Allied%20Force%20Headquarters">Allied Forces Headquarters</a> (AFHQ).
With Eighth Army passing to AFHQ's command, Middle East Command became somewhat of a military backwater. General Wilson succeeded Alexander as its commander-in-chief and during his tenure it mounted only one significant operation: the unsuccessful <a href="Dodecanese%20Campaign">Dodecanese Campaign</a> from September to November 1943.
After 1945, the Middle East Command was reformed as Middle East Land Forces. Middle East Land Forces commanded the forces in Libya (25th Armoured Brigade, which was later subsumed into <a href="10th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">10th Armoured Division</a>) until 1957, and the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Infantry Division</a>, <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Infantry Division</a>, two armoured regiments and other forces, in the <a href="Suez%20Canal%20Zone">Suez Canal Zone</a> until the early 1950s.
In 1959 Middle East Command was divided into two commands split by the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>.
The two parts were <a href="British%20Forces%20Aden">"British Forces Arabian Peninsula"</a>, which was based at <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, and the rump of the former Command which was based in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and which in 1961 was renamed <a href="Near%20East%20Command">Near East Command</a>.
Middle East Command was disbanded on 28 November 1967 and the command of British forces in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> was transferred to Headquarters, British Forces Gulf which was based in <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>.

Middle East Theatre of World War II

The Middle East Theatre of World War II is defined largely by reference to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a>, which controlled <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a> in both <a href="Southwest%20Asia">Southwest Asia</a> and eastern <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. From 1943, most of the action and forces concerned were in the adjoining <a href="Mediterranean%2C%20Middle%20East%20and%20African%20theatres%20of%20World%20War%20II">Mediterranean Theatre</a>.
The region was quiet for the first few months of the war, until <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Fascist Italy</a> declared war against <a href="France">France</a> and Britain on June 10, 1940. It remained a major active theatre for two and a half years until the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a> <a href="British%20Eighth%20Army">Eighth Army</a> crossed the border from <a href="Libya">Libya</a> into <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. In February 1943, command of the Eighth Army passed from the Middle East Command to the Allied Joint command for the Mediterranean, <a href="AFHQ">AFHQ</a>. The Middle East Theatre remained quiet for the remainder of the war.
The Allies initially believed that the Middle East (Southwest Asia) could become a major operational theatre, because they thought that the Germans might invade the area. This did not materialise, although when Allied forces occupied much of the area, in anticipation of such an invasion, there was fighting against <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> forces in <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20campaign">Lebanon and Syria</a>, and against <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a href="Anglo-Iraqi%20War">Anglo-Iraqi War</a>.
The Italian forces in North Africa greatly outnumbered the Allies. However, Allied forces were able to not only defend against Italian attacks but also to defeat the Italians and occupy their colonies in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="Somaliland">Somaliland</a>. By February 1941, Commonwealth forces appeared to be on the verge of overrunning the last Italian forces in Libya, which would have ended Axis control in all of Africa.
While the fighting was taking place in Libya, Axis forces were attacking <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. The Allied commander, General <a href="Archibald%20Wavell">Archibald Wavell</a>, was ordered to stop his advance against Libya and send troops to Greece. He disagreed with this decision but followed his orders.
The Allies were unable to stop Greece falling to the Axis forces and before they could retake the initiative in the Western Desert the German "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" had entered the theatre. It would not be until early in 1943, after another year and a half of hard fighting and mixed fortunes, that the Axis forces would be finally driven out of Libya and the theatre would again become a backwater.
In late 1940, the Italians attacked Greece from Albania in the <a href="Greco-Italian%20War">Greco-Italian War</a>. Not only did the Greeks stop the attack, they forced the Italians back. Eventually, in the spring of 1941, the Germans <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">intervened in Greece</a>. They also <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invaded Yugoslavia</a> concurrently.
The Greeks had been reluctant to allow Commonwealth ground forces into the country, because Britain could not spare enough forces to guarantee victory. They had, however, accepted aid from the RAF in their war with the Italians in Albania. The trigger for Commonwealth forces moving to Greece in large numbers was the entry of German forces into Bulgaria, which made clear the German intent to invade Greece.
Commonwealth forces took position on a defensive line running from north-west to south-east across the northern part of Greece. However, there were critical weaknesses in the defences. The Greek forces in the area were further forward than the Commonwealth forces, and the Greek Government ignored suggestions that they should withdraw to a common line. The Greek forces were thus defeated in detail. There was also a large gap between the left flank of Commonwealth forces and the right flank of the Greek forces in Albania. That was exploited fully by the Germans.
After being expelled from the Greek mainland, Commonwealth forces retreated to Crete. There, the Germans again exploited weaknesses in the defences with a bold invasion plan. In the largest and last German airborne assault, paratroops landed at several points on the island and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> began. In all but one location, they were cut off and destroyed, and the follow-on seaborne forces were dispersed by the Allied navies. However, that one location was enough, and reinforcements were flown in to the point where the Germans were strong enough to break out and take the rest of the island.
Command in London eventually decided the cause was hopeless, and ordered a withdrawal from <a href="Sfakia">Sfakia</a>. Over the next four nights 16,000 troops were taken off Crete to Egypt. A smaller number were withdrawn on a separate mission from <a href="Heraklion">Heraklion</a>, but these ships were attacked en-route by Luftwaffe <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and suffered serious losses. On 1 June the remaining 5,000 defenders at Sfakia surrendered, although many took to the hills and caused the German occupation problems for years.
During the evacuation of Crete Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Browne%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a> was determined that the "navy must not let the army down", when Mr. Winnie stated their fears that too many ships would be lost, Cunningham said, "It takes three years to build a ship, it takes three centuries to build a tradition." Nevertheless, large numbers of Allied soldiers were taken prisoner on Crete.
On 4 August 1940, Italy's forces in <a href="Italian%20East%20Africa">Italian East Africa</a> ("Africa Orientale Italiana", AOI) invaded <a href="British%20Somaliland">British Somaliland</a>. The Italians took the British colony's capital city of <a href="Berbera">Berbera</a> on 19 August. The Italians also staged very minor attacks across the Sudanese and Kenyan borders in 1940.
Italian success in East Arica was short-lived. On 19 January 1941, <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a> forces counter-attacked from <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> in the north and <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> in the south. On May 6, the capital city of AOI, <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, fell. <a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a> had managed to enter the city on 5 May. On 18 May, Prince <a href="Amedeo%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Aosta">Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta</a>, the Italian Governor-General of AOI, surrendered in <a href="Amba%20Alagi">Amba Alagi</a> which all but ended hostilities. Some isolated Italian units fought on. But, when the Italian forces under General <a href="Guglielmo%20Nasi">Guglielmo Nasi</a> in <a href="Gondar">Gondar</a> surrendered on 27 November, major Italian resistance ended.
In March 1942 the <a href="Indian%2010th%20Infantry%20Division">Indian 10th Infantry Division</a> was in Iraq. It had fought Iraq, and in the invasions of Syria, Lebanon, and Persia. As its soon to be promoted commander Major-General <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">William Slim</a> wrote: "We could move we could fight and we had begun to build up that most vauable of all assets a tradition of success. ... it was stimulating to be at what we all felt was a critical spot, waiting for the threatened German invasion of Turkey."
Although <a href="Southwest%20Asia">Southwest Asia</a> was destined to remain a strategic backwater for the duration of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, in late 1941 and early 1942 the Allies were not certain that it would remain so. Before the turning points of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> (June 1942 to February, 1943) and the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a> (October to November 1942), the fear was that the Germans might attack the area either through Turkey, or via Cyprus into Lebanon; or through defeating of the <a href="British%208th%20Army">British 8th Army</a> in Egypt. If the anticipated attack came through Turkey or Lebanon, then not only could the <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a> threaten British controlled Egypt and the strategically important <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> via an advance through Palestine and the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>, it would also allow the Germans an alternative route to attack the Soviet Union from Southwest Asia north through the USSR's southern frontiers. In the slightly longer term the British feared independent regimes in the region as well as the possibility that the Germans might follow in <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great's</a> footsteps and attack <a href="British%20India">British controlled India</a> from Persia in the west as Japan simultaneously attacked India from the east through <a href="Burma%20Campaign">Burma</a>.
<a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces in the region were for the most part under the Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> based in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. The exception was Persia which for some of the time came under the command of the <a href="Commander-in-Chief%20in%20India">Commander-in-Chief in India</a>.
Starting in July 1940, the Italian bombings in the <a href="Mandate%20Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> were primarily centered on <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> and <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a>. However, many other coastal towns such as <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> and <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> also suffered. On 9 September 1940, a bombing raid on Tel Aviv caused 137 deaths.
As in most of the Arab world, there was no unanimity amongst the Palestinian Arabs as to their position regarding the combatants in WWII. Some signed up for the British army - into the mixed <a href="Palestine%20Regiment">Palestine Regiment</a> unit, but others saw an Axis victory as their best hope of gaining Arab control of Palestine. Some of the leadership went further, especially the <a href="Grand%20Mufti%20of%20Jerusalem">Grand Mufti of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Haj%20Amin%20Al-Husseini">Haj Amin Al-Husseini</a> (by then settled in Axis occupied Europe), who on November 25, 1941, formally declared "jihad" against the Allied Powers. During the war, the British forbade entry of Jews into Palestine escaping Nazi persecution, placing them in detention camps or deporting them to other places such as <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>. However, over 30,000 Palestinian Jews fought for Great Britain during World War II, within the regular British army, <a href="Palestine%20Regiment">Palestine Regiment</a> and the <a href="Jewish%20Brigade">Jewish Brigade</a>. David Ben Gurion, leader of the Jewish Agency, which was the mainstream Zionist organization in Palestine, had said "We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper." By 1940, The Haganah and other underground Jewish militias ordered complete cease fire with the British, in favor of the joint war effort against the Axis, but continued smuggling attempts of Jewish refugees from Iraq and Europe into <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine">British Palestine</a>.
Iraq had been officially granted independence by the United Kingdom in 1932, under a number of conditions, including the retention of British military bases. This caused resentment within Iraq and a pro-Axis prime minister, <a href="Rashid%20Ali">Rashid Ali</a>, assumed control. In early 1941, Ali ordered British forces to withdraw.
The Middle East Command hastily assembled a formation known as <a href="Iraqforce">Iraqforce</a> — which included the <a href="Indian%2010th%20Infantry%20Division">Indian 10th Infantry Division</a> and the <a href="Arab%20Legion">Arab Legion</a> — and it arrived on April 18. There were two main British military bases in Iraq, at <a href="Basra">Basra</a> and at <a href="RAF%20Habbaniya">Habbaniya</a>, north east of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>. On April 30 the Iraqi Army surrounded and besieged the isolated and poorly defended <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> base at Habbaniya. Although the base had no offensive aircraft, RAF personnel converted training aircraft to carry weapons, and attacked the Iraqi forces.
Habbaniya was soon relieved by <a href="Iraqforce">Iraqforce</a>, which defeated the larger but poorly trained Iraqi Army in a series of battles, even though the Iraqis received direct aid from the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>". Iraqforce pressed on from Habbaniya to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and then to <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>. <a href="Rashid%20Ali">Rashid Ali</a> and his supporters fled the country and an <a href="armistice">armistice</a> was signed. Prior to the arrival of British forces to Baghdad, the power vacuum erupted into a series of massacres and looting (<a href="Farhud">Farhud</a>), in which the <a href="Baghdadi%20Jews">Baghdadi Jewish community</a> was hit particularly hard.
A Luftwaffe aircraft was shot down over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. Since the nearest Axis bases were on <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, the Allies realised that the plane had refueled in <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> controlled Syria or Lebanon. This confirmed suspicions among the Allies regarding the "armed neutrality" of Vichy territories.
Australian, <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a>, British and Indian units invaded Syria and Lebanon from Palestine in the south on 8 June 1941. Vigorous resistance was put up by the Vichy. However, the Allies' better training and equipment, as well as the weight of numbers eventually told against the Axis. Further attacks were launched at the end of June and early July from <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> into northern and central Syria by troops from <a href="Iraqforce">Iraqforce</a>. By 8 July the whole of north east Syria had been captured and elements of Iraqforce advancing up the river Euphrates were threatening <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> and as a consequence the rear of the Vichy forces defending Beirut from the advance from the south. Negotiations for an armistice were started on 11 July and surrender terms signed on 14 July.
The final major military operation in the war in the Middle East campaign took place shortly thereafter. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent round the <a href="North%20Cape%2C%20Norway">North Cape</a> convoy route to <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> and <a href="Archangel">Archangel</a>, but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from America to <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The <a href="Shah">Shah</a> of Iran was deemed as pro-German; he would not allow this free access. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Iran. The Shah was deposed and his son put on the throne.
After the fall of France and before United States land forces entered the war in <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, the north African campaign in the Sahara desert and Mediterranean coastal plains of Libya and western Egypt was the major land front between Western Allied and Axis forces.
In September 1940, Italian forces stationed in Libya crossed the border and launched an <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">invasion into Egypt</a>. After advancing to <a href="Sidi%20Barrani">Sidi Barrani</a> they set up defensive positions in order to regroup and resupply before continuing.
In December, the outnumbered Allied forces launched <a href="Operation%20Compass">Operation Compass</a> which was initially to be a five-day raid against the Italian defensive positions in Egypt. Ultimately the raid turned into a full-scale counter-offensive against Italian forces in Egypt and Libya. The operation was more successful than planned and resulted in the capture of the Libyan province of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a> and the advance of the Allied forces as far as <a href="El%20Agheila">El Agheila</a>. Over 100,000 Italian prisoners were taken.
The defeat of Italian forces did not go unnoticed and soon the German Africa Corps ("<a href="Deutsches%20Afrikakorps">Deutsches Afrikakorps</a>"), commanded by <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>, were sent in to reinforce the Italians. Although ordered to simply hold the line, Rommel launched an offensive from El Agheila in March 1941 which, with the exception of <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Tobruk</a>, managed to press the Allies beyond <a href="Sallum">Salum</a> on the Egyptian border, effectively putting both sides back at their approximate pre-war positions.
During the following stalemate, the Allied forces were reinforced and reorganised as the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a>. In addition to British formations, the army was made up of divisions from the armies of several countries: the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a>, the <a href="South%20African%20Army">South African Army</a>, and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Army">New Zealand Army</a>. There was also a brigade of <a href="Free%20French">Free French</a> under <a href="Marie-Pierre%20Koenig">Marie-Pierre Koenig</a>. In November 1941 the new formation launched a new offensive, <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a>, and recaptured almost all of the territory recently acquired by Rommel and lifting the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>. Once again, the <a href="front%20line">front line</a> was at El Agheila.
After receiving supplies from <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, Rommel was able to push the Allies back to Gazala, west of Tobruk. After a period when both sides were rebuilding their strength, the Axis forces defeated the Allies in May 1942 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>, capturing Tobruk, and drove them back to past the border of Egypt. Deep into Egypt, the Axis forces were halted in July at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">First Battle of El Alamein</a>.
At this point General <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Harold Alexander</a> took over as commander-in-Chief <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> and Lieutenant-General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> took over the Eighth Army under him. After victory in the defensive battle of <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20Halfa">Alam Halfa</a> in late August and early September, the Eighth Army went on the offensive in October 1942 and decisively defeated the Axis at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second El Alamein</a>. The Axis forces were pursued through Libya and the capital Tripoli was captured by Eighth Army in January 1943.
After the advance of the Eighth Army into eastern <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> in early 1943, <a href="18th%20Army%20Group">18th Army Group</a> was formed to control Eighth Army and <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> which was attacking Tunisia from the west after the successful Allied <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a> in November 1942. Strategic command of Eighth Army thus passed from C-in-C <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East Command</a> to <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, the Joint Allied Commander of <a href="AFHQ">AFHQ</a>, under which 18th Army Group came.
The British Middle East Command was based in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> with responsibility for Commonwealth operations in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, and also those in <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>, <a href="Iran">Persia</a>, and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, including <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. In August 1942 forces in Persia and Iran (known as <a href="Paiforce">Paiforce</a>) were detached and brought under the separate, newly formed Persia and Iraq Command under General Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a> (the post having been turned down by Auchinleck, the outgoing Middle East Command C-in-C).

Wimbledon Chase railway station

Wimbledon Chase railway station is in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Merton">London Borough of Merton</a> in <a href="South%20London">South London</a>. The station is served by <a href="Thameslink%20and%20Great%20Northern">Thameslink</a> trains on the <a href="Sutton%20Loop%20Line">Sutton Loop Line</a>. It is in <a href="Travelcard%20Zone%203">Travelcard Zone 3</a> and is arranged as an island eight-car platform, with stairs descending to street level towards the southern end.
Parliamentary approval for a line from <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> to <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> had been obtained by the <a href="Wimbledon%20and%20Sutton%20Railway">Wimbledon and Sutton Railway</a> (W&amp;SR) in 1910 but work had been delayed by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. From the W&amp;SR's inception, the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a> (DR) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> (LER, precursor of <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>) planned, through its ownership of the DR, to use part of the route for an extension of the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> (C&amp;SLR, now the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>) to Sutton. The <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">SR</a> objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&amp;SLR to extend as far as <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a> in exchange for the LER giving up its rights over the W&amp;SR route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area. The station opened on 7 July 1929 when the first section of the line to South Merton came into operation. The route opened to Sutton on 5 January 1930.
The typical off-peak service from the station is 2 trains per hour to <a href="Wimbledon%20station">Wimbledon</a> (clockwise around the loop) and 2 trains per hour to <a href="Sutton%20railway%20station%20%28London%29">Sutton</a> (anticlockwise).

Operation Lea

Operation Léa was <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> military operation between 7 October and 8 November 1947 during the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>. It was an attempt by the French General Valluy to crush the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a>. An <a href="airborne%20force">airborne force</a> would capture the Viet Minh leadership and three French columns would strike into the Viet Minh heartland.
The parachute assault surprised the Viet Minh, nearly capturing <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a> and <a href="Vo%20Nguyen%20Giap">General Giap</a>, but it soon recovered and began ambushing the three French columns.
The operation was soon called off and the French forces withdrew to the lowlands. It was a tactical success, inflicting severe casualties on the Viet Minh, but strategically indecisive, because it failed to capture the Viet Minh leadership or seriously cripple its military forces.
After the outbreak hostilities on 19 December 1946, the French Union forces had made significant progress by capturing the major cities <a href="Haiphong">Haiphong</a>, <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>, <a href="Lang%20Son">Lang Son</a>, <a href="Cao%20Bang">Cao Bang</a> as well as nearly the complete western and southern region of <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>, which was the stronghold of the Viet Minh movement. The reasons for the fast advance were the superior firepower, naval and air support of the French forces. The major forces of the Viet Minh were nearly surrounded by the French in the eastern part of Tonkin. There remained only a greater gap between the towns Cao Bang in the north and Yên Bái in the south. During April 1947 <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a> made a last attempt to achieve a ceasefire and to continue the negotiations with the French government about Vietnamese independence from 1946. But the French only demanded his surrender, because the position of the Vietnamese forces seemed to be desperate. But on 26 April, he refused the French, offering: "In the French Union is no place for cowards. I would be one, if I would accept." During the rest of the spring and the summer, the French made assaults to the bases of the Viet Minh troops in Tonkin but could not force them to a conventional battle. Instead the Viet Minh returned when the French moved on.
The French supreme command in Indochina under General <a href="Jean-%C3%89tienne%20Valluy">Jean-Étienne Valluy</a> realized that the recent tactics of minor assaults to locate the headquarters of the Viet Minh would not lead to an end of the war. From their intelligence department, they received some information that the location of the headquarters of the Viet Minh was in the city <a href="Bac%20Kan">Bac Kan</a>. They planned to capture Ho Chi Minh and the staff of the Viet Minh and to gain a complete victory over the Vietnamese independence movement.
The operation started on 7 October with the airborne landing of 1,100 paratroopers at the city of Bac Kan. The paratroopers took over the control of the city swiftly, but could not capture Ho Chi Minh or any other of the Vietnamese leaders.
At the same time, ten battalions of French troops (strength est. 15,000 men) started moving from the city of <a href="Lang%20Son">Lang Son</a> to <a href="Cao%20Bang">Cao Bang</a> in the north and then down through <a href="Nguy%C3%AAn%20B%C3%ACnh%20District">Nguyen Binh</a> to Bac Kan. The primary target of this action was to cut off the Viet Minh from any supplies which could reach them from China. The second objective was to surround the Vietnamese forces completely and destroy them during a battle. Delayed by bad roads, mines and ambushes it took the French column until 13 October to reach the vicinity of Bac Kan where the Viet Minh put up a strong resistance. The French finally broke through on 16 October to relieve the beleaguered paratroops. Meanwhile, a four battalion riverine force that was supposed to assault up the Clear and <a href="G%C3%A2m%20River">Gam</a> Rivers was so delayed by sandbars and other obstructions that they played no useful part in the battle. The French were unable to destroy the Viet Minh forces with most of the 40,000 guerrillas escaping through gaps in the French lines. Among them were the leader Ho Chi Minh and his staff with General <a href="Vo%20Nguyen%20Giap">Vo Nguyen Giap</a>. On 8 November, it was called off. At the end of the operation, French claimed the Vietnamese forces had suffered a loss of 9,000 men.
After the failure of Operation Léa and the later <a href="Operation%20Ceinture">Operation Ceinture</a>, the French supreme command changed tactics again. Because of financial and economic reasons, France was not able to send more troops to Indochina. The French began to establish outposts on the major roads (Route Coloniale 4 and Route Coloniale 3) in an attempt to restrict Viet Minh movement in northeast Tonkin, but the Viet Minh could easily slip through these lines and reinforce themselves from across the Chinese border. This would take the war from the now established stalemate into the first Viet Minh victories in 1949/1950.

Heterostyly

Heterostyly is a unique form of <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphism</a> and <a href="herkogamy">herkogamy</a> in <a href="flower">flower</a>s. In a heterostylous species, two or three morphological types of flowers, termed "morphs", exist in the population. On each individual plant, all flowers share the same morph. The flower morphs differ in the lengths of the <a href="pistil">pistil</a> and <a href="stamen">stamen</a>s, and these traits are not continuous. The morph <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> is genetically <a href="genetic%20linkage">linked</a> to <a href="gene">gene</a>s responsible for a unique system of <a href="self-incompatibility%20in%20plants">self-incompatibility</a>, termed <a href="heteromorphic%20self-incompatibility">heteromorphic self-incompatibility</a>, that is, the pollen from a flower on one morph cannot fertilize another flower of the same morph.
Heterostylous plants having two flower morphs are termed "distylous". In one morph (termed "pin" or "longistylous" flower) the stamens are short and the pistils are long; in the second morph (termed "thrum" or "brevistylous" flower) the stamens are long and the pistils are short; the length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph, and vice versa. Examples of distylous plants are the <a href="primula%20vulgaris">primrose</a> and many other "<a href="Primula">Primula</a>" species, <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a>, <a href="flax">flax</a> and other "<a href="Linum">Linum</a>" species, some "<a href="Lythrum">Lythrum</a>" species, and many species of "<a href="Cryptantha">Cryptantha</a>".
Heterostylous plants having three flower morphs are termed "tristylous". Each morph has two types of stamens. In one morph, the pistil is short, and the stamens are long and intermediate; in the second morph, the pistil is intermediate, and the stamens are short and long; in the third morph, the pistil is long, and the stamens are short and intermediate. "<a href="Oxalis%20pes-caprae">Oxalis pes-caprae</a>", purple loosestrife ("<a href="Lythrum%20salicaria">Lythrum salicaria</a>") and some other species of "Lythrum" are trimorphic.
The lengths of stamens and pistils in heterostylous flowers are adapted for <a href="pollination">pollination</a> by different <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s, or different body parts of the same pollinator. Thus, <a href="pollen">pollen</a> originating in a long stamen will reach primarily long rather than short pistils, and vice versa. When pollen is transferred between two flowers of the same morph, no <a href="fertilization">fertilization</a> will take place, because of the self-incompatibility mechanism.

COBIT

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) is a <a href="Software%20framework">framework</a> created by <a href="ISACA">ISACA</a> for <a href="Information%20technology%20management">information technology (IT) management</a> and <a href="Corporate%20governance%20of%20information%20technology">IT governance</a>. It is a supporting toolset that allows managers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues and business risks.
<a href="ISACA">ISACA</a> first released COBIT in 1996; ISACA published the version, COBIT 5, in 2012.
COBIT aims "to research, develop, publish and promote an authoritative, up-to-date, international set of generally accepted <a href="information%20technology%20controls">information technology control</a> <a href="objective%20%28goal%29">objectives</a> for day-to-day use by <a href="business%20manager">business manager</a>s, IT professionals and assurance professionals".
COBIT, initially an acronym for "Control objectives for information and related technology" (though before the release of the framework people talked of "CobiT" as "Control Objectives for IT"), 
defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT. The framework defines each process together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary <a href="Capability%20Maturity%20Model">maturity model</a>.
The framework supports <a href="governance">governance</a> of IT by defining and aligning business <a href="goal">goal</a>s with IT goals and IT processes.
COBIT provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT with business. COBIT 5 consolidates COBIT4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with TOGAF and ITIL.
The business orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process owners.
The process focus of COBIT 4.1 is illustrated by a process model that subdivides IT into four domains (Plan and Organize, Acquire and Implement, Deliver and Support, and Monitor and Evaluate) and 34 processes in line with the responsibility areas of plan, build, run and monitor. It is positioned at a high level and has been aligned and harmonized with other, more detailed, IT standards and good practices such as <a href="Committee%20of%20Sponsoring%20Organizations%20of%20the%20Treadway%20Commission">COSO</a>, <a href="Information%20Technology%20Infrastructure%20Library">ITIL</a>, <a href="Business%20Information%20Services%20Library">BiSL</a>, <a href="ISO%2027000">ISO 27000</a>, <a href="Capability%20Maturity%20Model%20Integration">CMMI</a>, <a href="TOGAF">TOGAF</a> and <a href="PMBOK">PMBOK</a>. COBIT acts as an integrator of these different guidance materials, summarizing key objectives under one umbrella framework that link the good practice models with governance and business requirements.
The COBIT 4.1 framework specification can be obtained as a complimentary PDF at the
<a href="http%3A//www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/cobit/Pages/Downloads.aspx">ISACA download website</a>. (Free self-registration may be required.)
COBIT 5 was released in April 2012. COBIT 5 consolidates and integrates the COBIT 4.1, Val IT 2.0 and Risk IT frameworks, and draws from ISACA's "IT Assurance Framework" (ITAF) and the "Business Model for Information Security" (BMIS). It aligns with frameworks and standards such as "Information Technology Infrastructure Library" (ITIL), "International Organization for Standardization" (ISO), "Project Management Body of Knowledge" (PMBOK), PRINCE2 and "The Open Group Architecture Framework" (TOGAF).
COBIT has had five major releases:
The COBIT components include:
Other <a href="http%3A//www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/cobit/Pages/Products.aspx">ISACA Publications</a> based on the COBIT framework include:
Regulatory requirements, e.g. those imposed by the <a href="Sarbanes-Oxley%20Act">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a>, frequently require organisations to have frameworks in place for risk mitigation, monitoring and control.
COBIT provides an attractive option to meet such requirements.
Companies that are publicly traded in the US are subject to the <a href="Sarbanes-Oxley%20Act">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a> of 2002. According to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Internal%20Auditors">IIA</a>, COBIT is one of the most commonly used frameworks to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley.
Companies that are publicly traded in South Africa are subject to the <a href="King%20III">King III</a> code of corporate governance.
According to Greetha Steenkamp of the University of Stellenbosch, COBIT is well aligned to the principles of King III, so COBIT can be used effectively to meet the IT governance framework requirements of King III.

Wavell Wakefield, 1st Baron Wakefield of Kendal

William Wavell Wakefield, 1st Baron Wakefield of Kendal (10 March 1898 – 12 August 1983), known as Sir Wavell Wakefield between 1944 and 1963, was an English <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> player for <a href="Harlequins%20%28rugby%29">Harlequins</a> and <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, President of the <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> and <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> politician.
Wakefield was born in <a href="Beckenham">Beckenham</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, the son of Roger William Wakefield. He was the brother of <a href="Edward%20Wakefield%20%28British%20politician%29">Sir Edward Wakefield, 1st Baronet</a>, also a Conservative politician. His youngest brother, <a href="Roger%20Cuthbert%20Wakefield">Roger Cuthbert Wakefield</a>, was an early British &amp; Irish Lion, touring on the <a href="1927%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20Argentina">1927 British Lions tour to Argentina</a>. He attended <a href="Sedbergh%20School">Sedbergh School</a> in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>, leaving during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> to join the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> at the Admiralty testing station at Hill of Oaks on <a href="Windermere">Windermere</a>.
After the war Wakefield became the captain of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> rugby team and joined Harlequins. On 11 October 1919, he made his debut for Harlequins against <a href="Richmond%20F.C.">Richmond</a> and he continued to play for the club for the next ten years. He occasionally played for other teams during this time, but Harlequins was always his main club. During his career with Harlequins, he appeared a total of 136 times, including 82 as captain, and he made his final appearance on 25 January 1930 against <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>. He scored 51 tries for the club, along with one penalty and 14 conversions. He was club captain in the seasons 1920/21, 1924/25 and 1927/28 to 1929/30.
In 1920, Wakefield made his England debut against Wales. He captained the Cambridge University team in 1922. In total, he appeared for England 31 times and was captain on 13 occasions. He led England to back-to-back <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29">Grand Slams</a>. His final appearance for England was against France in April 1927. Through his career, Wakefield's influence on the game was pronounced. As an excellent all-round athlete he helped revolutionise the role of the back row forward. Prior to Wakefield their role was mainly static—pushing in the set scrum and winning the ball in loose scrums (or rucks, as they later became). Wakefield's athleticism enabled him to play a more dynamic role: pressuring the opposition half backs in defence and supporting the attacks of the three quarters, and these remain the prime responsibilities of the modern open side flank forward. Rugby historian Barry Bowker described Wakefield thus; "A complete footballer, he had all the attributes – strength, weight and speed – of a great forward. He was a master of the art of dribbling with pace, was up with his backs to share in an attack and took and gave passes well".
He remained involved in rugby and was the RFU president in 1950. From 1950 to 1980 he was president of Harlequins. An all-round sportsman, Wakefield also became the president of the <a href="Ski%20Club%20of%20Great%20Britain">Ski Club of Great Britain</a>, the <a href="British%20Sub-Aqua%20Club">British Sub-Aqua Club</a> and the British Water Ski Federation. In 1999 Wakefield was inducted as the first English member of the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Rugby Hall of Fame</a>.
In 1931, Wakefield joined the <a href="Rediffusion">Rediffusion</a> radio company.
In 1935, he moved into politics, becoming <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> Member of Parliament (MP) for <a href="Swindon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Swindon</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>, he moved to <a href="St%20Marylebone%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">St Marylebone</a>. He was knighted in 1944 and in 1963, upon retiring from Parliament, was raised to the peerage as Baron Wakefield of Kendal, of Kendal in the County of <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a>. For many years he was an active member of the <a href="Conservative%20Monday%20Club">Conservative Monday Club</a>.
Apart from his sporting and political careers Wakefield was instrumental in the preservation of the <a href="Ravenglass%20%26amp%3B%20Eskdale%20Railway">Ravenglass &amp; Eskdale Railway</a> and Lake District Estates, being director of the former company after the death of Midlands stockbroker Colin Gilbert. Upon Wakefield's death, his daughter, the Hon. Mrs Joan Raynsford OBE, took over as the head director of the railway company. His other two daughters, the late Mrs Sheila Hensman OBE and Mrs Ruth Adorian OBE also became active directors.
In 1954, Wakefield bought a controlling shareholding in <a href="Ullswater%20%27Steamers%27">Ullswater 'Steamers'</a>, and in doing so saved the company from bankruptcy. The company is still controlled by his descendants.
Lord Wakefield of Kendal died in August 1983, aged 85, when the barony became extinct.

Tilehurst railway station

Tilehurst railway station is a <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a> in the suburb and former village of <a href="Tilehurst">Tilehurst</a>, west of <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> in <a href="England">England</a>. The station is served by local services operated by <a href="First%20Great%20Western">First Great Western</a>.
The station is on the original line of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, which opened in 1841, and was itself opened to traffic in 1882.
Tilehurst station is on the extreme northern edge of the suburb of Tilehurst, and at a much lower level than most of that suburb. The railway line and station occupy a strip of land between the <a href="A329%20road">A329 road</a> and the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, with the up relief platform on an embankment above the river bank.
The station has four platforms, one on each of the fast and relief (slow) lines, although the platforms on the fast lines see little use except during track works on the line between Reading and Didcot. The platforms are linked to each other and the station entrance, on the down fast platform, by a footbridge.
There is a waiting room in the middle platform which contains separate Ladies and Gents toilets. A small waiting room was built on the north platform, but although it looks old, it is of modern construction.
The Main Ticket Office on the south side is manned usually on weekday mornings but tickets can also be purchased from an automatic machine using Debit or Credit Cards only.
In 2013 the redundant Goods Shed was demolished to make way for a new footbridge. The line from Paddington to Wales has been scheduled to be electrified and the old footbridge does not have enough clearance for the electric wires to be hung underneath.
The new Footbridge was opened in early December 2013 and the old footbridge demolished the following week. The footbridge does not have lifts so disabled people still have to climb the stairs to the platforms in normal use.
Tilehurst station is served by stopping services run by Great Western Railway between and . Most of these services start or continue as semi-fast services between Reading and , and run twice "per" hour throughout most of the day, but only hourly on Sundays. Typical journey times are about 5 minutes to Reading, 35 minutes to Oxford, and just under one hour to Paddington.
The railway at Tilehurst was mentioned in less than glowing terms by <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a> in chapter 16 of "<a href="Three%20Men%20in%20a%20Boat">Three Men in a Boat</a>": "The river becomes very lovely from a little above Reading. The railway rather spoils it near Tilehurst, but from Mapledurham up to Streatley it is glorious."

Cricklewood railway station

Cricklewood railway station is in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Barnet">London Borough of Barnet</a> in <a href="north%20London">north London</a>. The station lies on the north-south <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a> where it crosses Cricklewood Lane. It is served by <a href="Thameslink%20and%20Great%20Northern">Thameslink</a> services on the cross-London <a href="Thameslink">Thameslink</a> route. It is in London <a href="Travelcard%20Zone%203">Travelcard Zone 3</a>.
It was opened in 1868 as Childs Hill and Cricklewood when the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> built its extension (now called the <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a>) to <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St. Pancras</a>. The station acquired its present name in 1903.
To the north of the station, a <a href="motive%20power%20depot">motive power depot</a> was built with a large <a href="roundhouse">roundhouse</a> in 1882, with a second in 1893. With this was built a large <a href="Brent%20sidings">marshalling yard</a> and, in later years, <a href="LMS%20Garratt">LMS Garratt</a>s would be seen with their massive trains of coal from <a href="Toton">Toton</a> in the <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> and <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> <a href="coalfield">coalfield</a>s.
A loop line, no longer in existence, was built heading north on the western side of the railway yard, then turning east "underneath" the main line at the viaduct over the River Brent (and also now the <a href="North%20Circular%20Road">North Circular Road</a>), then south on the eastern side. This obviously allowed trains to reverse direction, but also conveniently joined the railway yards on the two sides of the main lines.
Between 1899 and 1926, a number of proposals were put forward to build an <a href="Edgware%20Road%20Tube%20schemes">underground railway along the Edgware Road</a> from Central London to Cricklewood via Kilburn, and envisaged the construction of a Tube station at Cricklewood. None of the schemes succeeded and the line was never built.
<a href="Thameslink%20and%20Great%20Northern">Thameslink</a> run 24-hour services on the <a href="Thameslink">Thameslink</a> route. The typical off-peak service is four trains per hour southbound to <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Wimbledon%20station">Wimbledon</a> and <a href="Sutton%20railway%20station%20%28London%29">Sutton</a>, and four trains per hour northbound, of which two terminate at <a href="St%20Albans%20City%20railway%20station">St Albans</a> and two at . Thameslink services to and from Gatwick Airport, Three Bridges and Brighton stop here at night only, but pass through without stopping during the day. After midnight, an hourly service (not calling at Farringdon, City Thameslink or London Bridge) from Bedford to Three Bridges runs.
<a href="East%20Midlands%20Trains">East Midlands Trains</a> InterCity services from <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> and <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> run through at high speed on the <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a>, but do not stop. Interchange with these services can be made at Luton and <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras International</a>.
Refurbishment of Cricklewood station has been carried out on the subway with cladding, lighting and a repaired floor. A renewed ticket office window with improved use for wheel chair and hearing impaired people. 
A new station a little further north is proposed and the four platforms at Cricklewood station are not being extended from eight to 12 carriages. The other Thameslink stations north of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> remaining with eight-car platform lengths are and <a href="Kentish%20Town%20station">Kentish Town</a>. South of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> Elephant &amp; Castle southwards on the Thameslink suburban (Wimbledon/Sutton) loop, and on the Catford loop line towards Sevenoaks, will likewise remain eight-car stations. The <a href="Office%20of%20Rail%20Regulation">Office of Rail Regulation</a> has told <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> the procedure (using the Railways Act 1993) to close Cricklewood station if it was no longer viable following the construction of a proposed station at Brent Cross. The developers of the Brent Cross Cricklewood development are planning to upgrade Cricklewood station which they say would not happen if Cricklewood station were to close. National and London government support for the new station was confirmed in March 2014. The <a href="Brent%20Cross%20Cricklewood">Brent Cross Cricklewood</a> development project, as approved by Barnet Council, does include improving Cricklewood station's forecourt and providing step free access to all platforms.
From March 2009, <a href="Southeastern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southeastern</a> and Thameslink began running some peak hour trains from Sevenoaks to Luton, though in the off-peak these services turn back at Kentish Town.
Other trains from south of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> within the larger Thameslink network may call at the station from 2015, when it is likely that the existing Sutton Loop trains will terminate at <a href="Blackfriars%20railway%20station">Blackfriars</a>.
In early 2008, the London Group of the <a href="Campaign%20for%20Better%20Transport%20%28UK%29">Campaign for Better Transport</a> published a proposal for an off-road, mainly orbital <a href="North%20and%20West%20London%20Light%20railway">North and West London Light railway</a> (NWLLR), sharing the orbital <a href="Dudding%20Hill%20Line">Dudding Hill Line</a> freight corridor, and taking over at least one of the two <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> freight lines which run through Cricklewood station. If the scheme were to go ahead, it would provide one or maybe two extra light-rail platforms at the station.

Tan Tock Seng Hospital

The Tan Tock Seng Hospital (<a href="Abbreviation">Abbreviation</a>: TTSH; <a href="Simplified%20Chinese">Chinese</a>: 陈笃生医院; ) is the third-largest hospital in Singapore after the <a href="Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health%20%28Singapore%29">Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)</a> and <a href="Singapore%20General%20Hospital">Singapore General Hospital</a>, but its accident and emergency department is the busiest in the country largely due to its geographically centralised location. Set up in 1844 by entrepreneur and philanthropist <a href="Tan%20Tock%20Seng">Tan Tock Seng</a>, the hospital came under the international spotlight when it was designated as the sole treatment centre for the <a href="SARS">SARS</a> epidemic which struck the country in 2003.
Singapore was a successful trading centre. Large numbers of immigrants came, hoping to make their fortune here. The majority of immigrants were poor and destitute. <a href="Malnutrition">Malnutrition</a> was common and it was estimated that about 100 immigrants died each year from <a href="starvation">starvation</a>.
The <a href="British%20government">British government</a> set up a <a href="pauper">pauper</a>'s hospital in the 1820s but it closed in the 1830s because of insufficient funds. The government then suggested that the better-off members of each community take care of their own poor. Subsequently, some of the more benevolent members of the community responded. One such person was Tan Tock Seng, a successful businessman, philanthropist and the first Asian <a href="Justice%20of%20Peace">Justice of Peace</a>. In 1843, Tan offered funds for the construction of a hospital.
The <a href="foundation%20stone">foundation stone</a> of the Chinese Paupers' Hospital, Singapore's first privately funded hospital, was laid on 25 July 1844, on <a href="Pearl%27s%20Hill">Pearl's Hill</a>. Construction took three years and a shortage of funds saw the hospital stand empty for two more years. Finally, the first batch of patients was admitted in 1849. About 100 sick and destitute people had been housed in an <a href="Nypa%20fruticans">attap</a> shed at the foot of Pearl's Hill when a fierce storm destroyed the shed, leaving them homeless. Rather than have them wander the streets, the government decided to place them in the hospital. In the hospital's early years, money was a constant problem, alleviated from time to time by <a href="donation">donation</a>s from kind benefactors. A shortage of staff and no reliable <a href="water%20supply">water supply</a> also made things difficult.
Tan Tock Seng died in 1850 at the age of 52. Later on, the hospital's name was changed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and, in 1861, it relocated to new premises on the corner of <a href="Serangoon%20Road">Serangoon Road</a> and <a href="Balestier%20Road">Balestier Road</a>. A <a href="leper">leper</a>s' ward was also added. In 1903, the land on <a href="Moulmein%20Road">Moulmein Road</a>, where the present hospital stands, was bought.
By the 1980s, the hospital's services and patient intake were beginning to outgrow the 1950s hospital building. A new 15-storey building was constructed and officially opened on 1 April 2000.
As a result of a restructuring exercise in the local health-care scene, the hospital became a member of the <a href="National%20Healthcare%20Group">National Healthcare Group</a> in 2000.
The hospital prides itself as a pioneer in the development of <a href="Geriatric%20Medicine">Geriatric Medicine</a>, <a href="Infectious%20Diseases">Infectious Diseases</a>, Rehabilitation Medicine, <a href="Respiratory%20Medicine">Respiratory Medicine</a> and Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology. It is also a major referral centre for Geriatric Medicine, <a href="General%20Surgery">General Surgery</a>, <a href="Emergency%20Medicine">Emergency Medicine</a>, Diagnostic Radiology, <a href="Gastroenterology">Gastroenterology</a>, <a href="Otorhinolaryngology">Otorhinolaryngology</a> and <a href="Orthopedic%20surgery">Orthopedic surgery</a>.
In 2003, the hospital was declared the designated hospital for <a href="Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome">SARS</a> screening and treatment by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Singapore%29">Ministry of Health</a> due to its past experience with communicable diseases (the <a href="Communicable%20Disease%20Centre">Communicable Disease Centre</a> was located nearby) and was "effectively locked down" to contain the outbreak. At the lobby of the hospital, a memorial plaque was dedicated in memory of the hospital's doctors and healthcare workers, two of whom died of the disease, who worked tirelessly during the SARS epidemic and Minister of Health <a href="Gan%20Kim%20Yong">Gan Kim Yong</a> paid tribute to the hospital's staff.

The Tan Tock Seng Hospital Heritage Museum opened its doors on 25 July 2001. Honouring the legacy of its founder Mr Tan Tock Seng, the museum features a collection of <a href="Peranakan">Peranakan</a> items from the mid-19th century, during Mr Tan's time.
Medical equipment and hospital artefacts of yore capture the enduring spirit of Singapore's first community hospital dedicated "to care for the sick poor of all nations". The hospital's development and achievements – in particular, its pioneering role in the treatment of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> (1940s) and its monumental leadership in the fight against <a href="SARS">SARS</a> – are presented through narrative displays, salvaged historical objects and a time capsule.
The TTSH Heritage Museum is a member of the National Heritage Board's Museum Roundtable.
Tan Tock Seng Hospital's "The Art of Healing" programme, an initiative that aims to use the <a href="arts">arts</a> as a form of <a href="Art%20therapy">therapy</a> to soothe patients' mind and body and help them on their path to recovery, was launched on 6 February 2006. Through the arts, the hospital is transformed to a warm, welcoming and enriching environment for patients, families, staff and visitors, and helps to distract patients from their ailments, express their feelings and reduce <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>. By this, the hospital hopes that there will be an improvement in patients' <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> and intake of pain medication, which in turn should lead to faster recovery and a shorter length of hospital stay.
The programme is an ongoing project where activities such as exhibitions (paintings, pottery, wire sculptures, etc.) and performances (orchestras, big bands, string quartets, plays, dances, etc.) are unveiled regularly. This helps to promote the hospital as a centre of <a href="holistic">holistic</a> healing of mind and body, and transforms the hospital environment from a traditionally sterile, cold and fearful one to a warm, non-threatening and welcoming place of healing. The programme provides an enriching multi-cultural experience for patients and staff and welcomes artists of all art forms to be a part of these performances.
Under the arm of "The Art of Healing" programme, the hospital's Healing Sky Garden and Orchid Botanica were launched in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Of the top riders, it soon became clear that Sydney 2000 time trial gold medal winner Russian rider <a href="Viatcheslav%20Ekimov">Viatcheslav Ekimov</a> was setting the time to beat. The current world time trial champion, <a href="Michael%20Rogers%20%28cyclist%29">Michael Rogers</a> from Australia, appeared to match Ekimov's times, but faded in the final kilometres. <a href="Tyler%20Hamilton">Tyler Hamilton</a>, from the USA, had problems with his radio shortly after the start, and rode the race effectively without radio communication. Hamilton finished strongly claiming the gold medal for the USA, averaging 50.062 km/h to finish the 48 km course in 57:31.74. Ekimov was awarded the silver medal, with a time of 57:50.58 nearly 19 seconds behind Hamilton, with another American, Bobby Julich, in a time of 57:58.19 inching out Michael Rogers (58:01.67) for the bronze medal.
Michael Rich (58:09.46) from Germany finished 37 seconds behind Hamilton for fifth, with Kazakhstan rider Alexander Vinokourov 1:26 behind the leader. The last person to start, the 2000 Olympics road race winner and former world time trial champion <a href="Jan%20Ullrich">Jan Ullrich</a> from Germany, could not match the pace and ended with a time of 59:02.04, one and a half minutes behind Hamilton in seventh position.
<a href="Tyler%20Hamilton">Tyler Hamilton</a>'s gold medal came into question when he failed a blood doping test. He was initially allowed to keep the medal after a lab mix-up spoiled the backup blood sample. Hamilton subsequently failed another doping test during the following month's <a href="2004%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">Vuelta a España</a>. This time, the backup sample confirmed the offense, and Hamilton was given a two-year ban.
On May 20, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hamilton returned his gold medal to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after Hamilton acknowledged to 60 Minutes that he used doping products during his career. The International Olympic Committee responded in August 2012 by stripping Hamilton of his medal.

<doc id="1639156" title="Qutb" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639156">
Qutb

Qutb, Qutub, Kutb, Kutub, or Kotb (), means 'axis', 'pivot' or 'pole'. Qutb can refer to celestial movements and used as an astronomical term or a spiritual symbol. In <a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>, a Qutb is the perfect human being, "<a href="al-ins%C4%81n%20al-k%C4%81mil">al-insān al-kāmil</a>" (The Universal Man), who leads the saintly hierarchy. The Qutb is the Sufi spiritual leader that has a divine connection with God and passes knowledge on which makes him central to, or the axis of, Sufism, but he is unknown to the world. There is only one Qutb per era and he is an <a href="infallible">infallible</a> and trusted spiritual leader. He is only revealed to a select group of mystics because there is a "human need for direct knowledge of God".
According to the Institute of Ismaili Studies, "In mystical literature, such as the writings of al–Tirmidhi, Abd al–Razzaq and <a href="Ibn%20Arabi">Ibn Arabi</a> (d. 1240), [Qutb] refers to the most perfect human being who is thought to be the universal leader of all saints, to mediate between the divine and the human and whose presence is deemed necessary for the existence of the world."
In the teachings of <a href="Al-Hakim%20al-Tirmidhi">Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi</a>, there is evidence to suggest that the Qutb is the head of the saintly hierarchy which provides scriptural evidence to support the belief in the qutb. The hadīth attributed to Ibn Mas‘ūd has been used as proof that a qutb exists. This hadīth was called into question for its reliability of the "sanad" and was discarded by MuhammadRashīd Ridā.
There are two different conceptions of the Qutb in Sufism: temporal Qutb and cosmic Qutb. The temporal and cosmic qutb are connected which guarantees that God is present in the world at all times. The temporal qutb is known as "the helper" or "al-ghawth" and is located in a person on Earth. The cosmic qutb is manifested in the temporal qutb as a virtue which can be traced back to al-Hallādj. The temporal qutb is the spiritual leader for the earth-bound saints. It is said that all beings - secret, animate, and inanimate - must give the qutb their pledge which gives him great authority. The only beings exempt from this are "al-afrād", which belong to the angels; the "djinn", who are under the jurisdiction of Khadir; and those who belong to the tenth stratum of "ridjālal-ghayb".
Due to the nature of the Qutb, the location where he resides, whether temporal or cosmic, is questionable. It is thought by most that the Qutb is corporeally or spiritually present in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> at the <a href="Ka%27ba">Ka'ba</a>, which is referred to as his "maqām".
The cosmic Qutb is the "Axis of the Universe" in a <a href="Planes%20of%20existence">higher dimension</a> from which originates the power (ultimately from <a href="Allah">Allah</a>) of the temporal Qutb.
The cosmic hierarchy is the way that the spiritual power is ensured to exist through the cosmos. Two descriptions of the hierarchy come from notable Sufis. The first is <a href="Ali%20Hujwiri">Ali Hujwiri</a>'s divine court. There are three hundred "akhyār" (“excellent ones”), forty "<a href="abdal">abdā</a>l" (“substitutes”), seven "abrār" (“piously devoted ones”), four "awtād" (“pillars”) three "nuqabā" (“leaders”) and one qutb. 
The second version is <a href="Ibn%20Arabi">Ibn Arabī</a>’s which has a different, more exclusive structure. There are eight "nujabā" (“nobles”), twelve "nuqabā", seven "abdāl", four "awtād", two "a’immah" (“guides”), and the qutb.

<doc id="1639158" title="Sentimentality" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639158">
Sentimentality

Sentimentality originally indicated the reliance on feelings as a guide to truth, but current usage defines it as an appeal to shallow, uncomplicated emotions at the expense of reason.
<a href="Moral%20sense%20theory">Sentimentalism in philosophy</a> is a view in <a href="meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a> according to which morality is somehow grounded in moral sentiments or emotions. <a href="Sentimentalism%20%28literature%29">Sentimentalism in literature</a> is both a device used to induce a tender emotional response disproportionate to the situation at hand, (and thus to substitute heightened and generally uncritical feeling for normal ethical and intellectual judgments), and a heightened reader response willing to invest previously prepared emotions to respond disproportionately to a literary situation. 
"A sentimentalist", <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> wrote, "is one who desires to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it." In James Joyce's "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>", Stephen Dedalus sends Buck Mulligan a telegraph that reads "The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done." <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a> considered that 'Sentimentality, the ostentatious parading of excessive and spurious emotion, is the mark of dishonesty, the inability to feel...the mask of cruelty'. <a href="This%20Side%20of%20Paradise">This Side of Paradise</a> by <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, contrasts sentimentalists and romantics with Amory Blaine telling Rosalind, “I'm not sentimental--I'm as romantic as you are. The idea, you know, is that the sentimental person thinks things will last--the romantic person has a desperate confidence that they won't.” 
In the mid-18th century, a querulous lady had complained to <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Richardson</a>: "What, in your opinion, is the meaning of the word "sentimental", so much in vogue among the polite...Everything clever and agreeable is comprehended in that word...such a one is a "sentimental" man; we were a "sentimental" party". What she was observing was the way the term was becoming a European obsession - part of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> drive to foster the individual's capacity to recognise virtue at a visceral level. Everywhere in the sentimental novel or the sentimental comedy, 'lively and effusive emotion is celebrated as evidence of a good heart'. Moral philosophers saw sentimentality as a cure for social isolation; and <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a> indeed considered that "the poets and romance writers, who best paint...domestic affections, <a href="Jean%20Racine">Racine</a> and <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>; Richardson, <a href="Marivaux">Maurivaux</a> and <a href="Marie%20Jeanne%20Riccoboni">Riccoboni</a>; are, in such cases, much better instructors than <a href="Zeno%20of%20Citium">Zeno</a>" and the Stoics.
By the close of the century, however, a reaction had occurred against sentimental excess, now seen as false and self-indulgent - especially after <a href="Schiller">Schiller</a>'s division (1795) of poets into two classes, the "naive" and the "sentimental": natural and artificial.
In modern times "sentimental" is a <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a> term that has been casually applied to works of art and literature that exceed the viewer or reader's sense of <a href="decorum">decorum</a>—the extent of permissible emotion—and standards of <a href="taste">taste</a>: "excessiveness" is the criterion; "Meretricious" and "contrived" sham <a href="pathos">pathos</a> are the hallmark of sentimentality, where the morality that underlies the work is both intrusive and pat. 
'Sentimentality often involves situations which evoke very intense feelings: love affairs, childbirth, death', but where the feelings are expressed with 'reduced intensity and duration of emotional experience...diluted to a safe strength by <a href="idealisation">idealisation</a> and simplification'.
Nevertheless, as a social force sentimentality is a hardy perennial, appearing for example as 'Romantic sentimentality...in the 1960s slogans "flower power" and "make love not war"'. The 1990s public outpouring of grief at the <a href="Death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales%23Funeral">death of Diana</a>, 'when they go on about fake sentimentality in relation to Princess Diana', also raised issues about the 'powerful streak of sentimentality in the British character' - the extent to which 'sentimentality was a grand old national tradition'.
<a href="Baudrillard">Baudrillard</a> has <a href="cynicism%20%28contemporary%29">cynically</a> attacked the sentimentality of Western <a href="humanitarianism">humanitarianism</a>, suggesting that 'in the New Sentimental Order, the affluent become consumers of the "ever more delightful spectacle of poverty and catastrophe, and of the moving spectacle of our own attempts to alleviate it"'. There is also the issue of what has been called 'indecent sentimentality...[in] <a href="pornographic">pornographic</a>al pseudo-classics', so that one might say for example that ' "<a href="Fanny%20Hill">Fanny Hill</a>" is a "very" sentimental novel, a faked Eden'.
However in <a href="sociology">sociology</a> it is possible to see the "sentimental tradition" as extending into the present-day - to see, for example, '<a href="Talcott%20Parsons">Parsons</a> as one of the great social philosophers in the sentimental tradition of <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Burke</a>, <a href="McLuhan">McLuhan</a>, and <a href="Erving%20Goffman">Goffman</a>...concerned with the relation between the rational and sentimental bases of social order raised by the market reorientation of motivation'. <a href="Francis%20Fukuyama">Francis Fukuyama</a> takes up the theme through the exploration of 'society's stock of shared values as "<a href="social%20capital">social capital</a>" '.
In a 'subjective confession' of 1932, 'Ulysses: a Monolgue', the analytic psychologist Carl Jung anticipates Baudrillard when he writes: 'Think of the lamentable role of popular sentiment in wartime! Think of our so-called humanitarianism! The psychiatrist knows only too well how each of us becomes the helpless but not pitiable victim of his own sentiments. Sentimentality is the superstructure erected upon brutality. Unfeelingness is the counter-position and inevitably suffers from the same defects.' [Carl Jung: The Spirit in Man, Art and Literature, London: Routledge, 2003, p. 143]
Complications enter into the ordinary view of sentimentality, however, when changes in fashion and setting— the "climate of thought"—intrude between the work and the reader. The view that sentimentality is relative is inherent in <a href="John%20Ciardi">John Ciardi</a>'s "sympathetic contract", in which the reader agrees to join with the writer when approaching a poem. The example of the death of Little Nell in <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="The%20Old%20Curiosity%20Shop">The Old Curiosity Shop</a>" (1840–41), "a scene that for many readers today might represent a defining instance of sentimentality", brought tears to the eye of many highly critical readers of the day. The reader of Dickens, <a href="Richard%20Holt%20Hutton">Richard Holt Hutton</a> observed, "has the painful impression of pathos feasting upon itself."
'Recent <a href="feminist%20theory">feminist theory</a> has clarified the use of the term as it applies to the genre' of the sentimental novel, stressing the way that 'different cultural assumptions arising from the oppression of women gave liberating significance to the works' piety and mythical power to the ideals of the heroines'.
The sentimental fallacy is an ancient <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>al device that attributes human emotions, such as grief or anger, to the forces of nature. This is also known as the <a href="pathetic%20fallacy">pathetic fallacy</a>, 'a term coined by <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>...for the practice of attributing human emotions to the inanimate or unintelligent world' - as in 'the sentimental poetic trope of the "pathetic fallacy", beloved of <a href="Theocritus">Theocritus</a>, <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> and their successors' in the <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a> tradition.
The term is also used more indiscriminately to discredit any argument as being based on a misweighting of emotion: 'sentimental fallacies...that men, that we, are better - nobler - than we know ourselves to be'; 'the "sentimental fallacy" of constructing novels or plays "out of purely emotional patterns"'.

The Singapore General Hospital (<a href="abbreviation">abbrev</a>: SGH; ; ; ) is the largest and oldest <a href="hospital">hospital</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, of which the foundation of its first building was laid in 1821. The hospital is where the founding father of Singapore, <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>, was treated with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and it is also the hospital where he died.
The <a href="Singapore%20Health%20Services">Singapore Health Services</a> hospital occupies sprawling grounds at <a href="Outram%2C%20Singapore">Outram Park</a>, sharing space with four specialist medical centres, namely the <a href="Singapore%20National%20Eye%20Centre">Singapore National Eye Centre</a> (SNEC), the <a href="National%20Heart%20Centre">National Heart Centre</a> (NHC), the <a href="National%20Cancer%20Centre%20Singapore">National Cancer Centre</a> (NCC) and the <a href="National%20Dental%20Centre">National Dental Centre</a> (NDC).
The Singapore General Hospital was established in 1821, when the first General Hospital was located in the <a href="cantonment">cantonment</a> for <a href="military%20of%20Britain">British troops</a> near the <a href="Singapore%20River">Singapore River</a>. It later shifted to Pearl's Bank and then to the Kandang Kerbau district, before finally settling at <a href="Sepoy">Sepoy</a> Lines in <a href="Outram%2C%20Singapore">Outram</a> Road in 1882.
The modern history of Singapore General Hospital began on 29 March 1926, with the opening of 800 beds in the Bowyer, Stanley and Norris Blocks. Today, only the Bowyer Block with its historically distinctive <a href="clock%20tower">clock tower</a> remains. The Bowyer Block is now home to the <a href="Singapore%20General%20Hospital%23The%20SGH%20Museum">Singapore General Hospital Museum</a> (SGH Museum).
In 1981, the hospital was rebuilt, with its current 8-block complex housing in-patient wards, <a href="ambulatory">ambulatory</a> and support services, <a href="research">research</a> <a href="laboratories">laboratories</a> and a <a href="postgraduate">postgraduate</a> medical institute.
On 1 April 1989, the hospital was restructured, in an effort to modernise the organisation of the hospital, due to rapidly developing changes in healthcare services and patient expectations for better service. As a restructured hospital, the Singapore General Hospital is still 100 per cent government-owned and is a <a href="non-profit%20organisation">not-for-profit institution</a>. More than 60 per cent of the beds are allocated for subsidised patients, giving them access to an internationally established standard of affordable <a href="healthcare">healthcare</a>.
On 31 March 2000, following a major reorganisation of the public sector healthcare services initiated by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%2C%20Singapore">Ministry of Health</a>, the Singapore General Hospital came under the management of <a href="Singapore%20Health%20Services">Singapore Health Services</a> or SingHealth. The SingHealth Group currently serves the eastern sector of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> through a cluster network of 4 <a href="hospitals">hospitals</a>, 5 specialist centres and 7 polyclinics.
The Singapore General Hospital Museum is a repository of <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a> and records, where visitors can trace the long and rich <a href="history">history</a> of the Singapore General Hospital. It is also a place where one can learn about the development of medical specialties and <a href="medical%20education">medical education</a> in Singapore, presented with the aid of <a href="audio-visual">audio-visual</a> and <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> <a href="technology">technology</a>.
The SGH Museum was officially opened by <a href="President%20of%20Singapore">President</a> <a href="SR%20Nathan">SR Nathan</a> on 20 May 2005. The <a href="museum">museum</a> adopts a thematic approach in presenting the hospital's long history, where visitors get not just an insight into the significant developments of the hospital through the years, but also an understanding of the impact these incidents have on the people and the <a href="community">community</a>.

The station is served by local services operated by <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Great Western Railway</a>.
The station is on the original line of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, which was opened in stages: the portion between and opened on 1 June 1840, and Pangbourne was the first station out of Reading.
Pangbourne station is located close to the village centre, with main station buildings on the opposite side of the railway to the village. It has two platforms, one on each of the relief (slow) lines, whilst the fast lines pass behind the station. The platforms are linked to each other and the station entrance, on the up relief platform, by a pedestrian underpass.
Originally, the station also had platforms on the main (fast) lines. Some signs of their previous existence are still visible adjacent to platform 1. A consequence of their removal is that when the relief lines are closed for engineering work, local stopping services cannot call at Pangbourne, and a replacement bus service is required.
Pangbourne station is served by stopping services run by Great Western Railway between <a href="Reading%20railway%20station">Reading</a> and <a href="Oxford%20railway%20station">Oxford</a>. Most of these services start or continue as semi-fast services between Reading and <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">London Paddington</a>, and run twice an hour throughout most of the day, but only hourly on Sundays. Typical journey times are approximately 10 minutes to Reading, 30 minutes to Oxford, and one hour to Paddington. As a result, a faster journey to London can often be achieved by means of a change at Reading.

Reading comprehension

Reading comprehension is the ability to read text, process it and understand its meaning. An individual's ability to comprehend text is influenced by their traits and skills, one of which is the ability to make inferences. If word recognition is difficult, students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual <a href="word">word</a>s, which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read. There are a number of approaches to improve reading comprehension, including improving one's vocabulary and reading strategies.
Reading comprehension is defined as the level of understanding of a text/message. This understanding comes from the interaction between the words that are written and how they trigger knowledge outside the text/message. Comprehension is a "creative, multifaceted process" dependent upon four <a href="Theoretical%20linguistics">language skills</a>: <a href="phonology">phonology</a>, <a href="syntax">syntax</a>, <a href="semantics">semantics</a>, and <a href="pragmatics">pragmatics</a>. Proficient reading depends on the ability to recognize words quickly and effortlessly. It is also determined by an individual's cognitive development, which is "the construction of thought processes". Some people learn through education or instruction and others through direct experiences.
There are specific traits that determine how successfully an individual will comprehend text, including prior knowledge about the subject, well developed language, and the ability to make inferences. Having the skill to monitor comprehension is a factor: "Why is this important?" and "Do I need to read the entire text?" are examples. Lastly, is the ability to be self-correcting to solve comprehension problems as they arise.
Reading comprehension involves two <a href="levels%20of%20processing">levels of processing</a>, shallow (low-level) processing and deep (high-level) processing. Deep processing involves <a href="semantic">semantic</a> processing, which happens when we encode the meaning of a word and relate it to similar words. Shallow processing involves structural and phonemic recognition, the processing of sentence and word structure and their associated sounds. This theory was first identified by <a href="Fergus%20I.%20M.%20Craik">Fergus I. M. Craik</a> and Robert S. Lockhart.
Comprehension levels can now be observed through the use of a fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. fMRIs' are used to determine the specific neural pathways of activation across two conditions, narrative-level comprehension and sentence-level comprehension. Images showed that there was less brain region activation during sentence-level comprehension, suggesting a shared reliance with comprehension pathways. The scans also showed an enhanced temporal activation during narrative levels tests indicating this approach activates situation and spatial processing.
Initially most comprehension teaching was based on imparting selected techniques that when taken together would allow students to be strategic readers however in 40 years of testing these methods never seemed to win support in empirical research. One such strategy for improving reading comprehension is the technique called <a href="SQ3R">SQ3R</a>: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review that was introduced by Francis Pleasant Robinson in his 1946 book "Effective Study".
Between 1969 and to about 2000 a number of "strategies" were devised for teaching students to employ self-guided methods for improving reading comprehension. In 1969 Anthony Manzo designed and found empirical support for the ReQuest, or <a href="reciprocal%20teaching">Reciprocal Questioning Procedure</a>, it was the first method to convert emerging theories of social and imitation learning into teaching methods through the use of a talk rotation between students and teacher called <a href="cognitive%20modeling">cognitive modeling</a>.
Since the turn of the 21st century, comprehension lessons usually consist of students answering teachers' questions, writing responses to questions on their own, or both. The whole group version of this practice also often included "<a href="Round-robin%20tournament">Round-robin</a> reading", wherein teachers called on individual students to read a portion of the text. In the last quarter of the 20th century, evidence accumulated that the read-test methods were more successful assessing rather than teaching comprehension. Instead of using the prior read-test method, research studies have concluded that there are much more effective ways to teach comprehension. Much work has been done in the area of teaching novice readers a bank of "reading strategies," or tools to interpret and analyze text.
Instruction in comprehension strategy use often involves the <a href="gradual%20release%20of%20responsibility">gradual release of responsibility</a>, wherein teachers initially explain and model strategies. Over time, they give students more and more responsibility for using the strategies until they can use them independently. This technique is generally associated with the idea of <a href="Self-regulated%20learning">self-regulation</a> and reflects <a href="social%20cognitive%20theory">social cognitive theory</a>, originally conceptualized by <a href="Albert%20Bandura">Albert Bandura</a>.
Reading comprehension and vocabulary are inextricably linked. The ability to decode or identify and pronounce words is self-evidently important, but knowing what the words mean has a major and direct effect on knowing what any specific passage means. Students with a smaller vocabulary than other students comprehend less of what they read and it has been suggested that the most impactful way to improve comprehension is to improve vocabulary.
Most words are learned gradually through a wide variety of environments: television, books, and conversations. Some words are more complex and difficult to learn, such as <a href="homonym">homonym</a>s, words that have multiple meanings and those with figurative meanings, like <a href="idiom">idiom</a>s, <a href="simile">simile</a>s, and <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>s.
Several theories of vocabulary instruction exist, namely, one focused on intensive instruction of a few high value words, one focused on broad instruction of many useful words, and a third focused on strategies for learning new word etc...
The method of focusing of broad instruction on many words was developed by Andrew Biemiller who argued that more words would benefit students more, even if the instruction was short and teacher-directed. He suggested that teachers teach a large number of words before reading a book to students, by merely giving short definitions, such as synonyms, and then pointing out the words and their meaning while reading the book to students. The method contrasts with the approach by emphasizing quantity versus quality. There is no evidence to suggest the primacy of either approach.
The final vocabulary technique, strategies for learning new words, can be further subdivided into instruction on using context and instruction on using <a href="morphemes">morphemes</a>, or meaningful units within words to learn their meaning. Morphemic instruction has been shown to produce positive outcomes for students reading and vocabulary knowledge, but context has proved unreliable as a strategy and it is no longer considered a useful strategy to teach students. This conclusion does not disqualify the value in "learning" morphemic analysis - prefixes, suffixes and roots - but rather suggests that it be imparted incidentally and in context. Accordingly, there are methods designed to achieve this, such as Incidental Morpheme Analysis.
In the 1980s Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown developed a technique called <a href="reciprocal%20teaching">reciprocal teaching</a> that taught students to predict, summarize, clarify, and ask questions for sections of a text. The use of strategies like summarizing after each paragraph have come to be seen as effective strategies for building students' comprehension. The idea is that students will develop stronger reading comprehension skills on their own if the teacher gives them explicit mental tools for unpacking text.
"Instructional conversations", or comprehension through discussion, create higher-level thinking opportunities for students by promoting <a href="critical%20thinking">critical</a> and <a href="Aesthetics">aesthetic thinking</a> about the text. According to <a href="V.T.%20Thayer">Vivian Thayer</a>, class discussions help students to generate ideas and new questions. (Goldenberg, p. 317). Dr. Neil Postman has said, "All our knowledge results from questions, which is another way of saying that question-asking is our most important intellectual tool" (Response to Intervention). There are several types of questions that a teacher should focus on: remembering; testing understanding; application or solving; invite synthesis or creating; and evaluation and judging. Teachers should model these types of questions through "think-alouds" before, during, and after reading a text.
When a student can relate a passage to an experience, another book, or other facts about the world, they are "making a connection." Making connections help students understand the author's purpose and fiction or non-fiction story.
There are factors, that once discerned, make it easier for the reader to understand the written text. One is the <a href="genre">genre</a>, like <a href="Fairy%20tale">folktales</a>, <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>, <a href="biography">biographies</a> or <a href="poetry">poetry</a>. Each genre has its own characteristics for text structure, that once understood help the reader comprehend it. A story is composed of a plot, characters, setting, point of view, and theme. Informational books provide real world knowledge for students and have unique features such as: headings, maps, vocabulary, and an index. Poems are written in different forms and the most commonly used are: rhymed verse, haikus, free verse, and narratives. Poetry uses devices such as: alliteration, repetition, rhyme, metaphors, and similes. "When children are familiar with genres, organizational patterns, and text features in books they're reading, they're better able to create those text factors in their own writing."
Visualization is a "<a href="mental%20image">mental image</a>" created in a person's mind while reading text, which "brings words to life" and helps improve reading comprehension. Asking sensory questions will help students become better visualizers.
There are a wide range of reading strategies suggested by reading programs and educators. The <a href="National%20Reading%20Panel">National Reading Panel</a> identified positive effects only for a subset, particularly summarizing, asking questions, answering questions, comprehension monitoring, graphic organizers, and cooperative learning. The Panel also emphasized that a combination of strategies, as used in Reciprocal Teaching, can be effective. The use of effective comprehension strategies that provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills, with intermittent feedback, has been found to improve reading comprehension across all ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.
Reading different types of texts requires the use of different reading strategies and approaches. Making reading an active, observable process can be very beneficial to struggling readers. A good reader interacts with the text in order to develop an understanding of the information before them. Some good reader strategies are predicting, connecting, inferring, summarizing, analyzing and critiquing. There are many resources and activities educators and instructors of reading can use to help with reading strategies in specific content areas and disciplines. Some examples are graphic organizers, talking to the text, anticipation guides, double entry journals, interactive reading and note taking guides, chunking, and summarizing.
The use of effective comprehension strategies is highly important when learning to improve reading comprehension. These strategies provide specific instructions for developing and retaining comprehension skills. Implementing the following instructions with intermittent feedback has been found to improve reading comprehension across all ages, specifically those affected by mental disabilities.
There are informal and formal assessments to monitor an individual's comprehension ability and use of comprehension strategies. Informal assessments are generally through observation and the use of tools, like <a href="story%20board">story board</a>s, <a href="word%20sort">word sort</a>s, <a href="interactive%20writing">interactive writing</a>, and shared reading. Many teachers use Formative assessments to determine if a student has mastered content of the lesson. Formative assessments can be verbal as in a Think-Pair-Share or Partner Share. Formative Assessments can also be Ticket out the door or digital summarizers. Formal assessments are district or state assessments that evaluates all students on important skills and concepts. Summative assessments are typically assessments given at the end of an unit to measure a student's learning.
Some texts, like in philosophy, literature or scientific research, may appear more difficult to read because of the prior knowledge they assume, the tradition from which they come, or the tone, such as criticizing or parodizing. Philosopher <a href="Jacques%20Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>, explained his opinion about complicated text: "In order to unfold what is implicit in so many discourses, one would have each time to make a pedagogical outlay that is just not reasonable to expect from every book. Here the responsibility has to be shared out, mediated; the reading has to do its work and the work has to make its reader." Other philosophers, however, believe that if you have something to say, you should be able to make the message readable to a wide audience.
Embedded <a href="hyperlinks">hyperlinks</a> in documents or Internet pages have been found to make different demands on the reader than traditional text. Authors, such as <a href="Nicholas%20G.%20Carr">Nicholas Carr</a>, and psychologists, such as <a href="Maryanne%20Wolf">Maryanne Wolf</a>, contend that the internet may have a negative impact on attention and reading comprehension. Some studies report increased demands of reading hyperlinked text in terms of cognitive load, or the amount of information actively maintained in one’s mind (also see <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>). One study showed that going from about 5 hyperlinks per page to about 11 per page reduced college students’ understanding (assessed by multiple choice tests) of articles about alternative energy. This can be attributed to the decision-making process (deciding whether to click on it) required by each hyperlink, which may reduce comprehension of surrounding text.
On the other hand, other studies have shown that if a short summary of the link’s content is provided when the mouse pointer hovers over it, then comprehension of the text is improved. "Navigation hints" about which links are most relevant improved comprehension. Finally, the background knowledge of the reader can partially determine the effect hyperlinks have on comprehension. In a study of reading comprehension with subjects who were familiar or unfamiliar with art history, texts which were hyperlinked to one another hierarchically were easier for novices to understand than texts which were hyperlinked semantically. In contrast, those already familiar with the topic understood the content equally well with both types of organization.
In interpreting these results, it may be useful to note that the studies mentioned were all performed in closed content environments, not on the internet. That is, the texts used only linked to a predetermined set of other texts which was offline. Furthermore, the participants were explicitly instructed to read on a certain topic in a limited amount of time. Reading text on the internet may not have these constraints.
The National Reading Panel noted that comprehension strategy instruction is difficult for many teachers as well as for students, particularly because they were not taught this way and because it is a very cognitively demanding task. They suggested that professional development can increase teachers/students willingness to use reading strategies but admitted that much remains to be done in this area. The <a href="directed%20listening%20and%20thinking%20activity">directed listening and thinking activity</a> is a technique available to teachers to aid students in <a href="literacy">learning how to un-read</a> and reading comprehension. It is also difficult for students that are new. There is often some debate when considering the relationship between reading <a href="fluency">fluency</a> and reading comprehension. There is evidence of a direct correlation that fluency and comprehension lead to better understanding of the written material, across all ages. However, it is unclear if fluency is a result of the comprehension or if this a separate learned task.

Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's points race

The women's points race in <a href="cycling%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">cycling</a> at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a> consisted of a 100 lap (25 kilometre) <a href="points%20race">points race</a> with 10 sprints where points were awarded. 5 points were given to the first finisher of each sprint, with 3 going to the second-place finisher, 2 going to the third place cyclist, and 1 going to the fourth place rider. Cyclists could also score points by lapping the main body of riders, known as the peloton. 20 points were gained by doing this, while 20 points were lost if the peloton lapped the cyclist.
Russian sprinter and 2004 Olympics road race bronze medallist, Olga Slyusareva, was able to win three of the ten sprints, and place in four other sprints to achieve 20 points. The <a href="peloton">peloton</a> was able to respond to any breakaways so no riders were able to achieve lap points. Mexican rider Belem Guerrero Méndez with 14 points was awarded the silver medal, closely followed by Maria Luisa Calle Williams from Colombia on 12 points. Calle Williams later tested positive for banned stimulant <a href="heptaminol">heptaminol</a>, and Erin Mirabella was promoted to the bronze medal position. That decision, however, was later reversed on appeal. It was proven Calle never ingested heptaminol, but a headache drug called Neosaldina, which contains a substance that will transform into <a href="heptaminol">heptaminol</a> during laboratory analysis. As a result of the IOC's October 24, 2005 decision, Mirabella was ordered to return the bronze medal and diploma and Calle's third-place result, bronze medal and diploma were re-instated.
No cyclists gained points from lapping the peloton. Three lost a lap, however.

Warumpi Band

Warumpi Band were an Australian <a href="country%20rock">country</a> and <a href="Aboriginal%20rock">Aboriginal rock</a> group which formed in the outback settlement of <a href="Papunya%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Papunya</a>, <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> in 1980. The original line-up was <a href="George%20Burarrwanga">George Burarrwanga</a> on vocals and <a href="didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>, Gordon Butcher on drums, his brother <a href="Sammy%20Butcher%20%28musician%29">Sammy Butcher</a> on guitar and bass guitar, and <a href="Neil%20Murray%20%28Australian%20musician%29">Neil Murray</a> on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. Their key singles are "<a href="Jailanguru%20Pakarnu">Jailanguru Pakarnu</a>" (1983), "<a href="Blackfella/Whitefella">Blackfella/Whitefella</a>" (1985), "Sit Down Money" (1986), "<a href="My%20Island%20Home">My Island Home</a>" (1987) and "No Fear" (1987). The group released three albums, "Big Name, No Blankets" (1985), "Go Bush!" (1987) and "Too Much Humbug" (1996). From late 1987 to mid-1995 the group rarely performed as Murray focused on his solo career. In early 1995, <a href="Christine%20Anu">Christine Anu</a> (former backing singer in Murray's touring group, The Rainmakers), issued a cover version of "My Island Home". Warumpi Band regrouped before disbanding in 2000. Burarrwanga died on 10 June 2007 of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>.
The Warumpi Band were formed in 1980 in <a href="Papunya%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Papunya</a> – an outback settlement about north-west of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a> in the Northern Territory – as a <a href="country%20rock">country</a> and <a href="Aboriginal%20rock">Aboriginal rock</a> group. <a href="Neil%20Murray%20%28Australian%20musician%29">Neil Murray</a>, was a Victorian-born schoolteacher and labourer who was working in the region. He met local brothers Gordon Butcher Tjapanangka and <a href="Sammy%20Butcher%20%28musician%29">Sammy Butcher Tjapanangka</a> of the <a href="Luritja">Luritja</a> people; and were joined by Sammy's brother-in-law <a href="George%20Burarrwanga">George Rrurrambu Burarrwanga</a> (aka George Djilangya), visiting from <a href="Elcho%20Island">Elcho Island</a>'s <a href="Yolngu">Yolngu</a> people. Murray provided rhythm guitar and backing vocals, Gordon was on drums, Sammy on guitar and bass guitar, and Burarrwanga on vocals and <a href="didgeridoo">didgeridoo</a>. 'Warumpi' derives from the Luritja word for a "honey-ant dreaming site", which lies near Papunya. Over the years, many different people played in the band at various times. The only consistent elements were Murray and Burarrwanga, with Sammy Butcher generally being available when band commitments did not take him too far from home for long.
The group began by playing cover versions of rock 'n' roll standards and toured the Northern Territory and the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley region</a> of northern Western Australia. In 1983 at the Aboriginal Country Music Festival they were voted as best band and by that stage they were playing more original material. In October that year they released their debut single, "Jailanguru Pakarnu" (Luritja for "Out from Jail") on the Hot label. It is the first song released in a rock music format which uses an <a href="Aboriginal%20language">Aboriginal language</a>, Luritja. For the single they were joined by another Butcher brother, Brian, on bass guitar. The track created mainstream media interest, and the group travelled to the interstate capitals of Melbourne and Sydney for gigs and TV appearances.
Warumpi Band built up a loyal following in Sydney's northern beaches <a href="Pub%20rock%20%28Australia%29">pub rock</a> scene, and played as a support act to <a href="Midnight%20Oil">Midnight Oil</a>. In 1985 the band signed with Midnight Oil's Powderworks label and released their debut album, "Big Name, No Blankets" in April. Australian rock music historian, <a href="Ian%20McFarlane">Ian McFarlane</a>, felt although "[g]rounded in early American R&amp;B and boogie as it was, the album was nevertheless an honest, enduring and bare-boned slice of indigenous country music". "Big Name, No Blankets" featured the single, "Blackfella/Whitefella", which appeared in October. The group undertook a national tour as well as playing in <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>.
In 1986, Midnight Oil and Warumpi Band embarked on the Blackfella/Whitefella Tour which reached some of the country's remotest locations. In July, while on tour, "Blackfella/Whitefella" was re-released as a track on the B-side of Midnight Oil's 12" shared single, "<a href="The%20Dead%20Heart">The Dead Heart</a>", and included tour mate <a href="Coloured%20Stone">Coloured Stone</a>'s track "This Land". After the tour the Butcher brothers left and the group signed with <a href="Festival%20Records">Festival Records</a>' imprint Parole Records. In October and November Burarrwanga and Murray were joined by Kenny Smith on bass guitar and backing vocals, and American-born Allen Murphy on drums to record their second album, "Go Bush!". It appeared in April 1987 and Murray Cook had joined on keyboards. In February that year they issued their next single, "<a href="My%20Island%20Home">My Island Home</a>", which had been written by Neil Murray about visiting Burarrwanga's homeland on Elcho Island.
The tour had inspired Midnight Oil's album, "<a href="Diesel%20and%20Dust">Diesel and Dust</a>" (August 1987), which was an international hit and brought the issues of land rights and aboriginal reconciliation into the national spotlight. For Warumpi Band the strain of balancing family commitments with the group took its toll and they were unable to capitalise on the groundswell created by the tour and their second album. By the end of 1988 Murray had embarked upon a solo career, although the band periodically reformed whenever it fitted in with their other activities. Murray issued his debut album, "Calm &amp; Crystal Clear", in 1989.
In 1995 <a href="Christine%20Anu">Christine Anu</a> (former backing singer in Murray's touring band, The Rainmakers) covered "My Island Home". Soon after Burarrwanga, Sammy Butcher and Murray reconvened Warrumpi Band for a European tour. In April 1996 they released their third album, "Too Much Humbug". The album was produced by Mark Ovenden (<a href="Yothu%20Yindi">Yothu Yindi</a>, Midnight Oil, <a href="You%20Am%20I">You Am I</a>). At the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%201997">ARIA Music Awards of 1997</a> the track, "Stompin' Ground", was nominated for 'Best Indigenous Release'. In the following years, reunion gigs were sporadic, generally for festivals and other one-off appearances. In 2000 Murray resigned from Warumpi Band and concentrated on his solo career which had already provided three further albums, "These Hands" (1993), "Dust" (1996) and "The Wondering Kind" (1999).
Burarrwanga continued to perform as a solo artist, and released a reggae album, "Nerbu Message" (2004), which included his version of "My Island Home" as "Ronu Wanga", sung in his native <a href="Dhuwal%20language">Gumatj dialect</a>. In 2007, he returned to his 'Island Home' on Elcho Island where he died from <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> on 10 June of that year. Sammy Butcher remained involved in music with a recording studio in Alice Springs, providing recording opportunities for outback youth. He recorded his own album of instrumental guitar tracks.
In 2015, Festival Records released the "Warumpi Band 4 Ever" box set, containing the band's three albums plus bonuses across two CDs. CD1 contained "Big Name, No Blankets" and "Go Bush", whilst CD2 contained "Too Much Humbug" and the following bonus tracks: an unreleased live recording from the band's final concert in Broome in 2000, the non-album A-side "Sitdown Money" that was later added to the Parole Records releases of "Big Name, No Blankets", the original recording of "Jailanguru pakarnu" released as a single in 1983 and four demos recorded in 1981.
Various members were temporary, touring or recording only. From late 1987 to early 1995 there was little group activity as members pursued other interests.

Chris Amon Racing (also known simply as Amon), was a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> team that competed in the <a href="1966%20Formula%20One%20season">1966</a> and <a href="1974%20Formula%20One%20season">1974</a> seasons.
Without a full-time drive in <a href="1966%20Formula%20One%20season">1966</a>, <a href="Chris%20Amon">Chris Amon</a> entered a <a href="Brabham%20BT11">Brabham BT11</a> powered by an old 2-litre <a href="British%20Racing%20Motors">BRM</a> engine at the <a href="1966%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> under the banner of "Chris Amon Racing", but failed to qualify.
After a poor season with <a href="Tecno%20%28motorsport%29">Tecno</a>, but encouraged by the potential of the underdeveloped <a href="Gordon%20Fowell">Gordon Fowell</a> chassis, driver <a href="Chris%20Amon">Chris Amon</a> tried running his own Formula One car in . Financial backing came from John Dalton, and the car, designed by Fowell, followed the <a href="Lotus%2072">Lotus 72</a> in some areas of construction, with sophisticated torsion-bar suspension and side radiators.
The venture failed completely: retiring from the first race, Amon withdrew from the second, and the car was unable to qualify for two more before the team closed down due to financial problems.
The AF101 was the only Formula One car built by Amon Racing; the AF101 designation deriving from A for Amon and F for Fowell. Fowell and <a href="Tom%20Boyce">Tom Boyce</a> designed the car which featured a single central fuel tank, titanium <a href="torsion%20bar">torsion bar</a>s and a forward driving position. One unusual (for the time) feature of the AF101 was that the fuel tank was located between the driver's cockpit and the engine. Structurally, it proved to be weak and was not ready for a Formula One appearance until the fourth race of the season, the <a href="1974%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>. Amon was only able to qualify 23rd, due to <a href="disc%20brake">brake-disc</a> vibration that became worse with the tyres required for the wet race that followed. Despite cautious driving, a <a href="inboard%20brake">brake shaft</a> finally broke and Amon was forced to retire after 22 laps.
Following further work and testing, Amon returned for the <a href="1974%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> and qualified twentieth, but due to mechanical problems, he was unable to start the race. Further problems meant Amon was not able to reappear with the AF101 until the <a href="1974%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> when both Amon and <a href="Larry%20Perkins">Larry Perkins</a> failed to qualify. Amon did not reappear with the AF101 until the <a href="1974%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a>, three races before the end of the season, but this time he was unable to qualify. That signalled the end of both the car and Chris Amon Racing, leaving Amon to close down the team after the race when the money ran out.

KK Women's and Children's Hospital

KK Women's and Children's Hospital (<a href="abbreviation">abbreviation</a>: KKH; <a href="Simplified%20Chinese">Chinese</a>: 竹脚妇幼医院; ), formerly known as "Kandang Kerbau Hospital", is the largest <a href="hospital">hospital</a> specialising in healthcare for women and children in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.
From its humble beginnings as a small general hospital in 1858 to a 30-bed <a href="maternity">maternity</a> hospital in 1924, KKH has grown into an 830-bed hospital providing <a href="obstetric">obstetric</a> and <a href="gynaecology">gynaecology</a>, <a href="neonatology">neonatology</a> and <a href="paediatric">paediatric</a> services. Often affectionally referred to as "KK" amongst locals, it is the birthplace of a sizeable proportion of Singaporeans, delivering over half of total newborns in the country as early as 1938.
In 1966, the hospital entered the <a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> for delivering the highest number of newborns within a single maternity facility for that year, and it continued to hold on to this record for a full decade, delivering 85% of the population.
In 1997, the hospital moved to its present site. In 2003, the old premises was marked as a <a href="historical%20site">historical site</a> by the <a href="National%20Heritage%20Board%20%28Singapore%29">National Heritage Board</a>, a tribute to an institution that has been the birthplace of over 1.2 million <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>ans since its inception.
The hospital's name comes from the Malay term for "buffalo shed" ("kandang" = shed / pen + "kerbau" = buffalo), reflecting the area's past link with buffalo rearing.
While the hospital started as one catering to health care for women, mainly for gynaecology and obstetrics, it has since expanded its role.
First, the paediatrics department was added for the care of the babies after delivery, but over the years it expanded into a full paediatric service, treating younger patients for all kinds of illnesses up to teenage. An offshoot, the neonatology service, was then added. Thus the expanded role of the hospital warranted a renaming to KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
Over the recent years, the scope of care has expanded even more to provide holistic care to women and children patients. It strives to become the "Healthcare Leader for Women and Children", which has become its slogan. New departments were added to the hospital. Paediatric surgery was first added, followed by others such as colorectal surgery, psychiatry and orthopaedics for women with illnesses requiring expertise in those areas.
As a result of a restructuring exercise in the local healthcare scene, the hospital became a member of the <a href="Singapore%20Health%20Services%20Private%20Limited">Singapore Health Services</a> on 1 April 2000.
KKH takes advantage of the social media and started its first Facebook account in April 2010. Currently, its Facebook page has gained some popularity.

Austrobaileya

Austrobaileya is the sole <a href="genus">genus</a> with the <a href="Monospecificity">sole recognised species</a> of <a href="liana">liana</a>s, that constitutes the entire <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Austrobaileyaceae. The species Austrobaileya scandens grows naturally only (<a href="Endemism">endemic</a>) in the <a href="Queensland%20tropical%20rain%20forests">Wet Tropics rainforests</a> of north eastern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia.
The name "A. maculata" is recognised as a synonym of "A. scandens".
"Austrobaileya" plants grow as woody lianas or vines. Their main growing stems loosely twine, with straight, extending, leafy branches. The leaves are leathery, veined and simple. The leaves produce <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a>s in spherical ethereal oil cells. Their foliage is damaged by <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> in direct sunlight, so it tends to grow beneath the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> <a href="canopy%20%28forest%29">canopy</a>, in low-sunlight and very humid conditions. Like many other flowering plants growing in the understory of tropical rainforest, it does not have palisade mesophyll tissue or low leaf photosynthetic rates. It relies strongly on vegetative reproduction for continuation of the species.
"A. scandens" is found only (endemic) in the Wet Tropics rainforests of Queensland, and is rare. It is the oldest species of flowering plants in Australia that requires <a href="pollination">pollination</a>. "Austrobaileya" is one of many ancient ('primitive') plants found in Wet Tropics that have survived millions of years of climatic and geological changes.
The species is well adapted to rainforests, where it can wind around tall woody trees that form the canopy. It is evolved for fitness in the wet tropical rainforest’s conditions of dampness, humidity, high-light canopy and low-light understory.

Naperville North contains over 250 certified staff members, with most of them having a master's degree or beyond. Naperville North is accredited to the Illinois State Board of Education and is a part of the Illinois Association for College Admission Counseling.
The building was constructed in 1970 comprising 152,347 square feet (14,000 m²). Additions to the building were made in 1974, 1986 and 1992, increasing the size to the current (as of 2005) 449,665 square feet (42,000 m²). From the time of its construction until the 1992-1993 academic year, Naperville North was the only high school in its district to have a swimming pool. Thus <a href="Naperville%20Central%20High%20School">Naperville Central High School</a> students who took Physical Education courses in swimming or desired to compete in swimming and/or diving would be bussed from Naperville Central to Naperville North. The stadium and pool underwent significant renovations during the 2008-2009 and 2010-2011 school years, respectively.
In 2008, Naperville North had an average composite <a href="ACT%20%28examination%29">ACT</a> score of 25.4, and graduated 100.0% of its senior class. Naperville North has not made <a href="Adequate%20Yearly%20Progress">Adequate Yearly Progress</a> (AYP) on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, which with the ACT, are the assessment tools used in Illinois to fulfill the federal <a href="No%20Child%20Left%20Behind%20Act">No Child Left Behind Act</a>. One student subgroup failed to meet expectations in reading and mathematics.

SD Gundam G Generation

SD Gundam G Generation is a series of <a href="Tactical%20role-playing%20game">strategy-RPG</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s that focus on the <a href="Gundam">Gundam</a> <a href="anime">anime</a> franchise.
The G Generation series technically began in 1996, when Bandai released a series of six games for <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Famicom</a> console's <a href="Sufami%20Turbo">Sufami Turbo</a> add-on, each focusing on a particular era from the Gundam multiverse. A Generation focused on the <a href="One%20Year%20War">One Year War</a>, B Generation focused on the Gryps Conflict, and so forth up to F Generation, which covered the plot of <a href="Mobile%20Fighter%20G%20Gundam">G Gundam</a>. Instead of continuing the obvious progression and making a G Generation game themed about <a href="Mobile%20Suit%20Gundam%20Wing">Gundam Wing</a>, Bandai held on to the title. Since "G" was often used as an abbreviation for "Gundam", it was decided that G Generation would encompass a wider scope. When it was finally released in 1998 for the <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>, G Generation covered the plot for <a href="Mobile%20Suit%20Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a> through and featured characters from the remaining <a href="Universal%20Century">Universal Century</a> series as well as <a href="Mobile%20Fighter%20G%20Gundam">G Gundam</a>, <a href="Mobile%20Suit%20Gundam%20Wing">Gundam Wing</a> and <a href="After%20War%20Gundam%20X">Gundam X</a>.
The G Generation's most distinctive feature is the fact that the machines are always depicted in a super deformed fashion. This may be to prevent problems with the different proportions used in various Gundam series, but a larger reason may be the fact that Sunrise has been known to charge a heavy licensing fee for full-sized versions of their mecha to appear in video games, a problem which also plagues the <a href="Super%20Robot%20Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> series of video games.
The G Generation series tends to operate in one of two ways in regards to plot. Most of the games released for home consoles faithfully recreate the plot of the series included, while most of the games for handheld systems feature a new storyline that combines elements of all the series' plots together while giving the characters new relationships. In addition to the familiar cast of Gundam characters, G Generation games often feature brand-new characters that represent the player's contributions to the game. Most of the time, the original characters have no plot impact on the game. However, the game Monoeye Gundams features a new group of characters with their own storyline that forms the overall plot of the game, supported by the events of the <a href="One%20Year%20War">One Year War</a> and the Gryps Conflict. G Generation DS follows this tradition by introducing a new character who ties in to the stories of both <a href="Mobile%20Suit%20Zeta%20Gundam">Zeta Gundam</a> and Monoeye Gundams.
Most of the G Generation games feature brand-new mobile suits and armors designed exclusively for the game. All of the machines are given a backstory that ties them into the <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> Gundam storyline, with most being incomplete or rejected prototypes. A vast majority of the original machines represent the <a href="Universal%20Century">Universal Century</a>, but so far every universe except Cosmic Era has received at least one original machine.
Unlike the popular <a href="Super%20Robot%20Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> series, G Generation does not limit characters to only piloting machines from their own universe. For example, <a href="Amuro%20Ray">Amuro Ray</a> could be made to pilot <a href="List%20of%20Mobile%20Suit%20Gundam%20Wing%20mobile%20weapons%23Wing%20Zero">XXXG-00W0 Wing Gundam Zero</a>. However, some restrictions still exist. Some machines can only be piloted by characters who belong to certain categories. Other restrictions are plot-based. 
Like <a href="Super%20Robot%20Wars">Super Robot Wars</a>, G Generation allows the player to convince certain enemy characters to join his team. Most of the time, this is represented by being able to save sympathetic characters who were on the "wrong" side of the conflict, such as 's and <a href="Mobile%20Suit%20Zeta%20Gundam">Zeta Gundam</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20Mobile%20Suit%20Zeta%20Gundam%20characters%23Four%20Murasame">Four Murasame</a>. Other times, the games allow the player to convince characters who would likely never join the heroes.
Most G Generation games allow the player to capture enemy machines and add them to his own roster. The console and some PSP G Generation games typically allow the player to capture enemy machines after their mothership is destroyed, while the other handheld games allow capture of damaged machines if they are surrounded by three or more player units. 
Featured only in the handheld G Generation games, ID Commands act in a similar fashion to <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">spells</a> in traditional <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>s, but are based around a character's memorable lines from the Gundam series. 
Usually linked to ID Commands, the handheld G Generation games often feature Hyper Modes for characters from all series. Earned through unique circumstances and activated by special ID Commands, Hyper Modes typically represent the peak of a character's power while piloting the mobile suit his/her most famous mobile suit. <a href="Universal%20Century">Universal Century</a> characters' Hyper Modes are typically a representation of their Newtype power reaching its peak, while the Alternate Universe series characters' Hyper Modes are usually linked to their Gundams' special systems. In console G Generation games, few unit like <a href="F91%20Gundam%20Formula%2091">Gundam F91</a> will activate the Hyper Mode when pilot has max morale. While in pocket games, such as G Generation DS, will let a pilot activate the Mobile Suit's Hyper Mode when a certain SP is reached.

Institute of Mental Health (Singapore)

The Institute of Mental Health (IMH; Chinese: 心理卫生学院; Tamil: மனநல நிலையம்) has a long tradition of care for psychiatric patients. In 2006, the Woodbridge Hospital compound, part of IMH, was marked as Singapore's 83rd historic site 
by the National Heritage Board due to its history as Singapore's first mental institution. As such, it is still referred to as "Woodbridge" by locals.
Present-day IMH is located on a 25-hectare campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park in the north-east of Singapore. It is Singapore's only tertiary psychiatric hospital and offers psychiatric, rehabilitative and counselling services to children, youth, adults and the elderly. 
IMH is a modern hospital, with 50 wards and 2010 beds for inpatients and seven specialist clinics for outpatients. It provides hospital-based services, runs satellite clinics at different locations in Singapore, and spearheads mental healthcare programmes in the community.
“To appreciate Woodbridge [Hospital] and its work, one must have a historical sense of development and movement. It has been a long battle from custodial care which provides simple refuge and security to community psychiatry that enables people to return to a normal life." (Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, Emeritus Consultant, Woodbridge Hospital/Institute of Mental Health, 1990)
The Institute of Mental Health (Abbreviation: IMH; Chinese: 心理卫生学院) has a long tradition of care for psychiatric patients. In 2006, the Woodbridge Hospital compound, part of IMH, was marked as Singapore's 83rd historic site by the National Heritage Board due to its history as Singapore's first mental institution.
The earliest psychiatric facility began as a 30-bed building at the corner of Bras Basah Road and Bencoolen Street in 1841. It was then known as ‘The Insane Hospital.’ It was renamed the ‘Lunatic Asylum’ in 1861, and moved to a site near the old Kandang Kerbau Maternity Hospital. In 1887, this hospital was moved to the ‘New Lunatic Asylum’, with a capacity for 300 patients, built at College Road (Sepoy Lines) to check an outbreak of cholera. In 1928, a 24-ward ‘The Mental Hospital’ was built along Yio Chu Kang Road. The ‘New Lunatic Asylum’ at Sepoy Lines and the ward at Pasir Panjang were closed down and 1030 patients were transferred to ‘The Mental Hospital’.
Spread out over 80 hectares of land, The Mental Hospital was then the largest medical facility in Singapore providing custodial care for the mentally ill, with a capacity for 1,400 patients. 
In the 1920s, caring for the mentally ill was mainly custodial in nature. Patients were segregated from the community and were cared for by a handful of expatriate nurses with the help of health attendants who were not trained in nursing.
After Singapore <a href="%20Fall%20of%20Singapore">surrendered</a> to the Japanese in 1942, about 700–800 seriously wounded civilian casualties were transferred from the General Hospital to The Mental Hospital, which was transformed into the Japanese Civilian and Military Hospital. The Japanese transferred about 500 'quieter' mental patients to St John's Island, where many starved to death. The remaining 1,000 were locked up and neglected, of which about 600 were transferred in 1944 to the Central Mental Hospital, Tanjong Rambutan, in Perak, Malaysia. Of these 600, after the war, only 329 returned.
For a brief period from 1945 to 1947, the British Royal Air Force from the nearby Seletar Airfield requisitioned the hospital for use to treat the sick and wounded of Allied servicemen and <a href="Japanese%20prisoners%20of%20war%20in%20World%20War%20II">Japanese POWs</a> after the end of hostilities of World War II. Thus, the female section was converted into the RAF Hospital while the male section was allocated for use as the Japanese Prisoners of War Hospital. It was known as the 81 Mobile Field Hospital until its return to normal civilian usage in 1947, this hospital was the first Royal Air Force hospital established after the Japanese surrender.
In 1946, the Mental Hospital was returned to its original function, housing some 440 mental patients. In 1951, to shake off some of the stigma associated with mental illness, the hospital was renamed Woodbridge Hospital (WH). This name was derived from the local Chinese name for the hospital area—'Pang Kio' ('Wooden Bridge') as there was a wooden bridge in the hospital vicinity in Yio Chu Kang.
By 1958, Woodbridge had accommodation for 2,000 patients. The Psychiatric School of Nursing was set up in 1954. In 1955, a social work department was formed as well as an improved occupational therapy service. Psychological services were started in 1956 and V.W. Wilson, the first clinically trained psychologist in Singapore, was contracted from the United Kingdom by the Colonial Medical Service to incorporate a psychological service within the mental health programme.
A Child Guidance Clinic was opened in 1970. This grew to become the Child Psychiatry Clinic and family therapy soon became used to treat the whole family and not just the child.
Community Psychiatric Nursing was set up in 1988 and psychiatric nurses conducted home visits to provide care, support and follow-up for patients within the community.
Up to 1981, psychiatry trainees were sent to the UK to train for the MRCPsychiatry (Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) qualification. From 1983 onwards, WH, in conjunction with the National University of Singapore Graduate School of Medical Studies, trains its own psychiatrists. The first locally trained Master of Medicine trainee in Psychiatry graduated in 1985.
In 1984 the Ministry of Health mooted the idea of a new psychiatric hospital to evolve from a largely custodial care model to one of community care for the benefit of the people. The prevention, early treatment and rehabilitation of clients with mental conditions would actively operate within the community as opposed to late treatment within an institution that would isolate them from everyday life and make it much harder for them to reintegrate into the community.
Plans were put in place for a very different hospital that would revolutionise mental healthcare in Singapore with further emphasis on training and new initiatives in mental health promotion and clinical research.
WH moved to its present 25-hectare premises in Hougang in 1993. With the move, WH was reorganised and renamed the Institute of Mental Health/Woodbridge Hospital to reflect its added commitment to research and training.
Present-day IMH is located on a 25-hectare campus at Buangkok Green Medical Park in the north-east of Singapore. It is Singapore's only tertiary psychiatric hospital and offers psychiatric, rehabilitative and counselling services to children, youth, adults and the elderly. 
IMH is a modern hospital, with 50 wards and 2010 beds for inpatients and seven specialist clinics for outpatients. It provides hospital-based services, runs satellite clinics at different locations in Singapore, and spearheads mental healthcare programmes in the community.
IMH is the only tertiary psychiatric hospital in Singapore and offers a multidisciplinary and comprehensive range of psychiatric, rehabilitative and counselling services. The 2010-bedded hospital serves the needs of three groups of patients—children and adolescents, adults, and the elderly.
It became the first mental health institution in Asia to receive Joint Commission International Accreditation in 2005, a highly reputable international accreditation of healthcare organisations.
Besides providing clinical services, IMH coordinates and oversees education of clinicians, nurses and allied health professionals in psychiatry and conducts research related to mental health.
It also plays a key role in developing capability in community agencies, such as family service centres, to enable their staff to provide support to persons with mental health problems in the community.
• General Psychiatry 
• Geriatric Psychiatry
• Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry 
• Community Psychiatry

In 2007, the <a href="http%3A//www.imh.com.sg/page.aspx%3Fid%3D129">National Mental Health Blueprint</a> was established by the Ministry of Health (MOH). With a reinvestment fund of $88 million over 5 years, its objective was to develop national capability in mental health services. IMH initiated a number of community-based programmes as part of the Blueprint, targeted at the three main population segments—children, adults and the elderly.
• Response, Early intervention and Assessment in Community mental Health (REACH)
REACH is a community-based mental health service which works closely with schools, community agencies and family doctors to help students with emotional, behavioural and/or developmental disorders. The REACH team supports helping professionals to broaden the scope of care given to students within the community.
• Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT)
CHAT is a national youth mental health programme that aims to make it easy and unthreatening for youths to seek advice and help for their emotional and mental health issues. The CHAT team does this by raising awareness of youth mental health, and providing a free, confidential assessment service and mental health information. CHAT also partners polytechnics and post-secondary institutions to reach out to and support their students.
• Community Mental Health Team (CMHT)
The CMHT comprising doctors, community psychiatric nurses, and allied health specialists provide community-based treatment and psycho-social rehabilitation of our patients so that they may continue to live in the community while working towards recovery. The team continues to monitor and care for patients after their discharge through regular home visits.
• Aged Psychiatry Community Assessment Treatment Service (APCATS)
APCATS is a community-based psychogeriatric clinical service which provides assessment and treatment for homebound or frail elderly patients with mental disorders. The APCATS team comprises geriatric psychiatrists, medical officers, psychologists, geriatric psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and medical social workers. The team makes home visits to patients to ensure that they continue to receive care for their conditions.
The key focus areas of research at IMH are mental health policy research and translational clinical research.
Key research spearheaded by IMH include:
• <a href="Psychiatric%20Epidemiology">Psychiatric Epidemiology</a>: Singapore Mental Health Study, Well-being of the Singapore Elderly Study

Since as long ago as 120 million years, they continue living today only in the <a href="Daintree%20Rainforest">Daintree</a> and <a href="Wet%20Tropics%20of%20Queensland">Wet Tropics rainforests</a> region of north-eastern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. They grow naturally only (<a href="Endemism">endemic</a>) in very few locations in north-eastern Queensland (e.g. in <a href="Daintree%20National%20Park">Daintree National Park</a>), in the very wet lowland parts of the forest, in groups of 10-100 trees together (rather than scattered individuals). Common names include Ribbonwood and Idiot Fruit .
Ribbonwood trees grow naturally in their wet tropical rainforest habitats as <a href="evergreen">evergreen</a>s up to about tall. The simple <a href="leaf">leaves</a> grow singly, in pairs or in whorls of 3-4, each one measuring about long and wide. The <a href="flower">flower</a>s measure in diameter, with all floral organs spirally arranged . The <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s are initially creamy white when the flower opens, then turn red as the flower ages. The "<a href="fruit">fruit</a>s" have very distinctive features and do not fit within the definition of true fruits as such: all the protective layers decay while still on the parent tree and each one released is an extremely large ( diameter) naked plant <a href="embryo">embryo</a> . This is one of the very largest embryos in flowering plants. It is very toxic, inducing symptoms (in <a href="cattle">cattle</a>) similar to <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> .
Plants have both male and female sex organs, but half of the <a href="flower">flower</a>s of the Ribbonwood do not produce any fertile female organs . Attracted by the scent and colour of the flower, small <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="thrip">thrip</a>s are the main floral visitors ; they crawl in and lay their eggs within the center of the flower, which contains the flower's <a href="pollen">pollen</a>. Within the flower some of the sticky pollen gets trapped on the insect's bodies, and if the next flower they visit is a receptive one, it will <a href="pollination">pollinate</a> and produce the seeds.
While most modern flowering plants produce seeds which have one <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a> (<a href="monocotyledon">monocotyledon</a>s) or two (<a href="dicotyledon">dicotyledon</a>s), the seedlings of the Ribbonwood have between two and five cotyledons. Also the Ribbonwood can produce more than one shoot per seed (usually one per cotyledon).
The seeds are currently mainly spread through gravity dispersal, the seeds rolling down the steep mountain slopes to find their new home. The seeds are so toxic that most animals cannot eat them without being severely poisoned; however it is known that the native Musky Rat-kangaroo does disperse and bury some of these seeds. It has been suggested that the seeds were formerly dispersed by the now-extinct <a href="Diprotodon">Diprotodon</a>, on the basis that many Australian marsupials are adapted to cope with the toxins in Australian plants.
The plants have adapted a unique poison, a chemical called Idiospermuline contained within the seed, to prevent animals eating them. Researchers discovered the poison affects transmission of messages between individual nerve cells, which may cause seizures. In small doses this chemical can be used to save lives.
The first European–Australians to recognise the trees were timber cutters south of <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> in the late 1800s, then it was thought to have become extinct. The Ribbonwood was then brought to the attention of the German botanist <a href="Ludwig%20Diels">Ludwig Diels</a>, who in 1902 described the species in the genus "<a href="Calycanthus">Calycanthus</a>" as "C. australiense", a remarkable disjunction for this otherwise <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n genus. It was later believed to be <a href="extinct">extinct</a> again, because when Diels finally returned to the location where this tree was found, the natural vegetation had been destroyed for a <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> farm.
The species was re-rediscovered in 1971, after the <a href="poison">poison</a>ous seeds of the plant were found in the stomachs of dying cattle in the region. In 1972, the Australian <a href="botanist">botanist</a> <a href="Stanley%20Thatcher%20Blake">S. T. Blake</a> reassigned it to the new family Idiospermaceae and the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Idiospermum" ("idio"-, "unusual", and "spermum", "seed"). In its 2003 revision, the <a href="Angiosperm%20Phylogeny%20Group">Angiosperm Phylogeny Group</a> retained it in the new genus, but restored the species to the family <a href="Calycanthaceae">Calycanthaceae</a>.

Subquotient

In the <a href="mathematics">mathematical</a> fields of <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a> and <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, a subquotient is a <a href="quotient%20object">quotient object</a> of a <a href="subobject">subobject</a>. Subquotients are particularly important in <a href="abelian%20categories">abelian categories</a>, and in <a href="group%20theory">group theory</a>, where they are also known as sections, though this conflicts with a different meaning in <a href="section%20%28category%20theory%29">category theory</a>.
For example, of the 26 <a href="sporadic%20group">sporadic group</a>s, 20 are subquotients of the <a href="monster%20group">monster group</a>, and are referred to as the "Happy Family", while the other 6 are <a href="pariah%20group">pariah group</a>s. 
A quotient of a subrepresentation of a representation (of, say, a group) might be called a subquotient representation; e.g., <a href="Harish-Chandra%27s%20subquotient%20theorem">Harish-Chandra's subquotient theorem</a>.
In constructive <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>, where the <a href="law%20of%20excluded%20middle">law of excluded middle</a> does not necessarily hold, one can consider the relation 'subquotient of' as replacing the usual <a href="order%20relation">order relation</a>(s) on <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinals</a>. When one has the law of the excluded middle, then a subquotient formula_1 of formula_2 is either the <a href="empty%20set">empty set</a> or there is an onto function formula_3. This order relation is traditionally denoted formula_4. If additionally the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a> holds, then formula_1 has a one-to-one function to formula_2 and this order relation is the usual formula_7 on corresponding cardinals.
The relation »is subquotient of« is transitive.
Let formula_8 groups and formula_9 and formula_10 be <a href="group%20homomorphism">group homomorphism</a>s, then also the composition
is a homomorphism.
If formula_12 is a subgroup of formula_13 and formula_14 a subgroup of formula_15, then formula_16 is a subgroup of formula_17. We have formula_18, indeed formula_19, because every formula_20 has a <a href="preimage">preimage</a> in formula_12. Thus formula_22. This means that the image, say formula_23, of a subgroup, say formula_14, of formula_25 is also the image of a subgroup, namely formula_26 under formula_27, of formula_13.
In other words: If formula_23 is a subquotient of formula_15 and formula_15 is subquotient of formula_13 then formula_23 is subquotient of formula_13.  ■

Critical Mach number

In <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a>, the critical Mach number (Mcr or M* ) of an <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> is the lowest <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a> at which the airflow over some point of the aircraft reaches the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a>, but does not exceed it.
At the lower critical Mach number, airflow around the entire aircraft is subsonic. At the upper critical Mach number, airflow around the entire aircraft is supersonic.
For all aircraft in flight, the airflow around the aircraft is not exactly the same as the airspeed of the aircraft due to the airflow speeding up and slowing down to travel around the aircraft structure. At the critical Mach number, local airflow in some areas near the airframe reaches the speed of sound, even though the aircraft itself has an airspeed lower than Mach 1.0. This creates a weak <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>. At speeds faster than the Critical Mach number the <a href="drag%20coefficient">drag coefficient</a> increases suddenly, causing <a href="drag%20divergence%20Mach%20number">dramatically increased drag</a>, and, in an aircraft not designed for <a href="transonic">transonic</a> or <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> speeds, changes to the airflow over the <a href="flight%20control%20surfaces">flight control surfaces</a> lead to deterioration in control of the aircraft.
In aircraft not designed to fly at or above the critical Mach number, shock waves in the flow over the wing and tailplane are sufficient to stall the wing, make control surfaces ineffective or lead to loss of control such as <a href="Mach%20tuck">Mach tuck</a>. The phenomena associated with problems at the critical Mach number became known as <a href="compressibility">compressibility</a>. Compressibility led to a number of accidents involving high-speed military and experimental aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s.
Although unknown at the time, compressibility was the cause of the phenomenon known as the <a href="sound%20barrier">sound barrier</a>. <a href="Subsonic%20aircraft">Subsonic aircraft</a> such as the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>, <a href="BF%20109">BF 109</a>, <a href="P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>, <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>, <a href="He%20162">He 162</a>, <a href="P-80">P-80</a> have relatively thick, unswept wings and are incapable of reaching Mach 1.0. In 1947, <a href="Chuck%20Yeager">Chuck Yeager</a> flew the <a href="Bell%20X-1">Bell X-1</a> (that also had an unswept wing but of much less thickness) to Mach 1.06 and beyond, and the sound barrier was finally broken.
Early <a href="transonic">transonic</a> military aircraft such as the <a href="Hawker%20Hunter">Hawker Hunter</a> and <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a> were designed to fly satisfactorily faster than their critical Mach number. They did not possess sufficient engine thrust to reach Mach 1.0 in level flight but could be dived to Mach 1.0 and beyond while remaining controllable. Modern passenger-carrying jet aircraft such as <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> and <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> aircraft have maximum operating Mach numbers slower than Mach 1.0.
<a href="Supersonic">Supersonic</a> aircraft, such as <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a>, the <a href="English%20Electric%20Lightning">English Electric Lightning</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20F-104">Lockheed F-104</a>, <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a>, and <a href="MiG%2021">MiG 21</a> are designed to exceed Mach 1.0 in level flight and therefore are designed with very thin wings. Their critical Mach numbers are higher than those of subsonic and transonic aircraft but still less than Mach 1.0.
The actual critical Mach number varies from wing to wing. In general a thicker wing will have a lower critical Mach number, because a thicker wing accelerates the airflow to a faster speed than a thinner one. For instance, the fairly thick wing on the <a href="P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a> has a critical Mach number of about .69. The aircraft could occasionally reach this speed in dives, leading to a number of crashes. The much thinner wing on the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> resulted in a Critical Mach number of about 0.89 for this aircraft.

William Franklin "Billy" Talbert (September 4, 1918 – February 28, 1999) was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="tennis">tennis</a> player and administrator.
He was ranked in the U.S. Top 10 13 times between 1941 and 1954, and was ranked World No. 3 in 1949 by John Olliff of <a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>. He won nine Grand Slam doubles titles, and also reached the men's doubles finals of the U.S. National Championship nine times, mainly with his favorite partner, <a href="Gardnar%20Mulloy">Gardnar Mulloy</a>. He also was a Davis Cup player and one of the most successful Davis Cup captains in U.S. history.
Talbert was a Type 1 <a href="diabetic">diabetic</a>, one of the few known to be in sports at a highly competitive level, and for many years was held up as an example of how this disease could be surmounted.
Born in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, Talbert still holds records at the <a href="Cincinnati%20Masters">Cincinnati Masters</a> in his hometown. His records are for most doubles titles (six), most total finals appearances (14), and most singles finals appearances (seven). He won three singles titles (in 1943, '45 &amp; '47), and his six doubles titles came in 1943, '44, '45, '47, '51 &amp; '54.
Talbert also won the singles title at the <a href="U.S.%20Men%27s%20Clay%20Court%20Championships">U.S. Clay Court Championship</a> in 1945 and was a finalist in 1946 and '43. Before starting out on the international tour, he played for the University of Cincinnati and won an Ohio State singles title in 1936 while at Cincinnati's Hughes High School.

Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian/Harmonization

This page should evolve into a list of common Russian geographical and personal names, so that the standard policy on conventional naming could be evolved. It would eventually be incorporated into <a href="Transliteration%20of%20Russian%20into%20English">Transliteration of Russian into English</a> or given a separate article if deemed appropriate.
The origin of most modern given <a href="Russian%20name">Russian name</a>s lies in Calendar of Saints that mentions various names from Biblical sources, translated/transcribed/transliterated and adopted from Greek, Latin and Hebrew, on a daily basis. These names were forced into use over <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Slavonic</a> (mostly with "slav" ending which means Slava, glory, and "mysl" ending for thought) and <a href="Varangian">Varangian</a> names by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> somewhere around the rule of Tsar Ioann IV; the priests would not allow any name not in the Calendar to be registered. Thus, the real Slavic names were treated as <a href="paganism">pagan</a> and are really rare since then. These names were not reused until the historical works of the 1800s that re-introduced them to the public.
Most Russians did not have any other name than given name; they were usually known as "Pashka, son of Ivashka"; the "ka" suffix meant the low social status. Only the noble people were addressed to by applying the patronymic form, and only the noble ones were using surnames – usually, <a href="boyars">boyars</a> who were named after their <a href="udel">udel</a>. In the late 1700s, the ordinary people were given some artificial surnames that reflected the place of their birth, their profession, appearance, social status etc. But creating surnames after the Calendar was not an uncommon practice as well. Even some rarely used names and/or adaptations were used and they survived in family names.
Here's a list of most common modern (1800s) and older notable Russian given names. Since most of the current names are of foreign origin, it's fine to Anglicize some names that have a common English spelling which sounds similar to the Russian one.
Please add items to the bottom of this list using the template below:
Russian middle names are patronymics ("son of") which were originally used as families. Every person had name of his father (or some other male name) applied to his given name, usually constructed by adding "ov" or "yev". When the current families were created, they became indistinguishable from patronymics (old: Nikolay Nikolayev); to distinguish them, a suffix is applied to what was an original patronymic, usually "ich" in masculine form and "na" in feminine form (modern: Nikolay Nikolayevich). This creates even more controversy because in old patronymics (and most modern family names) the accent was on the same syllable as the name, but in modern use the accents often separated. Note that many Slavic families are also ending with "ich" (or Ç, Č, Ĉ).

<doc id="1639310" title="Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639310">
Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford

Henry de La Poer Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Patrick">KP</a> (26 April 1811 – 29 March 1859), styled Lord Henry Beresford before 1824 and Earl of Tyrone between 1824 and 1826, was an <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Irish peer</a>.
He was the second son of the <a href="Henry%20Beresford%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Waterford">2nd Marquess of Waterford</a>, but became heir apparent to the marquessate on the death of his elder brother, George Beresford, Earl of Tyrone, in 1824. He succeeded to the <a href="marquess">marquess</a>ate on his father's death in 1826.
In the early hours of Thursday, 6 April 1837, Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford and his fox-hunting friends arrived in Melton Mowbray at the Thorpe End tollgate. They had been drinking heavily at Croxton races, and understandably the tollkeeper asked to be paid before he opened the gate for them. Sadly for him some repairs were underway, and ladders, brushes and pots of red paint were lying nearby; the Marquess and his cronies seized these and attacked the tollkeeper, painting him and a constable who intervened red. They then nailed up the door of the tollhouse and painted that red before moving into the town carrying the purloined equipment. They rampaged down the Beast Market (now Sherrard Street), through the Market Place, and into Burton Street, painting doors as they passed, pulling on door knockers and knocking over flower pots. At the Red Lion (now part of the Harborough Hotel), they pulled down the sign and threw it into the canal. At the Old Swan Inn in the Market Place, next to what is now the Grapes, the Marquess was hoisted onto the shoulder of another man to paint the carved swan inn sign there red. (In 1988, when the old Swan Porch fell down, traces of red paint were found on the back of the carved swan when it was removed for restoration). They also vandalised the Post Office and the Leicestershire banking company before trying to overturn a caravan in which a man was fast asleep. Solitary policemen tried to intervene at intervals and were beaten up and painted red for their trouble. Eventually more police arrived in numbers and seized one of the men, Edward Raynard, who was put in the Bridewell prison. The others promptly returned and rescued him, breaking three locks and beating two constables, threatening them with murder if they did not produce the key. The following day there was uproar; when the Marquess of Waterford finally sobered up, he paid for all the damage to people and property, but the group were still brought to trial before the Derby Assize Court in July 1838. They were found not guilty of riot, but were fined £100 each for common assault, a considerable sum then. Following the incident, the phrase "paint the town red" entered the language .
A popular rumour that was in circulation as early as the 1830s claimed that Lord Waterford was the main suspect behind the "<a href="Spring%20Heeled%20Jack">Spring Heeled Jack</a>" phenomenon. However, as that character's acts continued after his death in 1859, Waterford cannot be given sole responsibility.
That Lord Waterford had some role has been accepted by several modern authors, who suggest that a humiliating experience with a woman and a police officer could have given him the idea of creating the character as a way of "getting even" with police and women in general. They speculate that he could have designed (with the help of friends who were experts in applied mechanics) some sort of apparatus for special spring-heeled boots, and that he may have practiced fire-spitting techniques in order to increase the unnatural appearance of his character. They also note the embroidered <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> with a "W" letter observed by the servant boy during the Ashworth incident, a notorious coincidence with his title's territorial designation.
Indeed, Waterford was frequently in the news in the late 1830s for drunken brawling, brutal jokes and vandalism, and was said to do anything for a bet; his irregular behaviour and his contempt for women earned him the moniker "the Mad Marquis", and it is also known that he was present in the London area at the time the first Spring Heeled Jack incidents took place. He was also pointed to as the perpetrator by the Revd E. C. Brewer in 1880, who attested that Waterford "used to amuse himself by springing on travellers unawares, to frighten them, and from time to time others have followed his silly example".
An 1838 news report referred to "that turbulent piece of aristocracy" and his "nocturnal vagaries in the neighbourhood of Melton", adding that his "name in many quarters is regarded with as much terror as that of Spring-heeled Jack himself".
Lord Waterford was a keen horseman and in <a href="1840%20Grand%20National">1840</a> he entered two horses in the <a href="Grand%20National">Grand National</a> <a href="Steeplechase">Steeplechase</a>, regarded today as the most famous race over jumps in the world. Waterford chose to ride one of the horses, The Sea, himself but was sent off in a field of thirteen runners as a totally unconsidered outsider. Reporters noted that, at one stage during the four and a half mile contest, The Sea was almost half a mile behind the leaders, but Waterford persisted and completed the course to finish last of four to complete the course.
In 1842, Lord Waterford married <a href="Louisa%20Beresford%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Waterford">Louisa Stuart</a>, daughter of the <a href="Charles%20Stuart%2C%201st%20Baron%20Stuart%20de%20Rothesay">1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay</a>, and settled in <a href="Curraghmore">Curraghmore House</a> in Ireland, where he reportedly led an exemplary life until he died in a horse riding accident in 1859. Spring Heeled Jack remained notionally active for decades after, which leads the aforementioned modern researchers to the same conclusion as Brewer's: Waterford may well have been responsible for the first attacks, while it was up to other pranksters who occasionally imitated him to continue the task.

Garry Tallent

Garry Wayne Tallent (born October 27, 1949, <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>), sometimes billed as Garry W. Tallent, is an American musician and record producer, best known for being bass player and founding member of the <a href="E%20Street%20Band">E Street Band</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s primary backing band since 1972. As of 2013, and not counting Springsteen himself, Tallent is the only original member of the E Street Band remaining in the band. Tallent was inducted as a member of the E Street Band into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>.
Growing up in <a href="Neptune%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Neptune City</a> around the <a href="Jersey%20shore">Jersey shore</a>, Tallent took up first the <a href="tuba">tuba</a> and then the bass. He was influenced by <a href="James%20Jamerson">James Jamerson</a>, <a href="Donald%20%26quot%3BDuck%26quot%3B%20Dunn">Donald "Duck" Dunn</a>, and <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. He started playing with Springsteen in 1971 in two earlier bands and then was an original member of the E Street Band, who formed in 1972. Both visually and musically he stays in the background though his bass plays a key role in Springsteen's music; his most notable bass parts may be on the song "<a href="Fire%20%28Springsteen%20song%29">Fire</a>" and the last verse of "<a href="Incident%20on%2057th%20Street">Incident on 57th Street</a>". During the E Street Band's early years, he occasionally played the tuba on some of Springsteen's quirkier early songs, both in concert and on record (most notably "<a href="Wild%20Billy%27s%20Circus%20Story">Wild Billy's Circus Story</a>").
In addition to his work with Springsteen, Tallent has recorded with numerous other artists. In 1987 Tallent produced the song "<a href="Crying%2C%20Waiting%2C%20Hoping">Crying, Waiting, Hoping</a>" for <a href="Marshall%20Crenshaw">Marshall Crenshaw</a> on "<a href="La%20Bamba%20%28film%29">La Bamba</a>" soundtrack. During the long time the E Street Band was inactive in the 1990s, Tallent moved to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, having an affinity for <a href="country%20and%20western">country and western</a> and <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> music. (By this point, Tallent had already long been referred to by the nickname "The Tennessee Terror," a name given to him after once driving through Tennessee briefly on a roadtrip). There he opened the MoonDog recording studio and helped start the D'Ville Record Group label. Tallent has produced such artists as <a href="Jim%20Lauderdale">Jim Lauderdale</a> and <a href="Steve%20Forbert">Steve Forbert</a>.
Tallent currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife Tammy and his two teenage children Isaac and Olivia.

London Towers

London Towers was a professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> team based in <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. They enjoyed some success in the 1990s, collecting 3 titles in the <a href="British%20Basketball%20League">British Basketball League</a> (BBL) as well as regularly competing in European competitions such as the <a href="Euroleague">Euroleague</a> and <a href="Saporta%20Cup">EuroCup</a>. They contested a fierce rivalry with fellow London team <a href="Greater%20London%20Leopards">Greater London Leopards</a> for much of this spell. After several years of decline with financial difficulties and venue issues, owner Costi Zombanakis pulled the first team from the BBL in the summer of 2006, and although the team continued in the regional <a href="English%20Basketball%20League">English Basketball League</a>, the London Towers brand folded in 2009.
Established as Tower Hamlets, in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Tower%20Hamlets">borough of the same name</a>, the <a href="London">London</a>-based team entered <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">NBL</a> Division 2 in 1984. By 1989 they finished eleventh, out of the eleven teams in the league and were due to be relegated. However, the <a href="British%20Basketball%20League">Carlsberg League Division 1</a> was suffering a membership crisis at the time and was about to be reduced to just seven teams. With the newly built <a href="London%20Arena">Docklands Arena</a> available as a possible venue not too far from the team's base, the Tower Hamlets franchise was admitted to country's top professional league as London's representatives, rebranded as London Docklands for the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20British%20Basketball%20League%20season">1989-90 season</a>.
The following season the Docklands team left the giant arena as they, in common with other basketball teams at the time, struggled with the cost of a big arena rent. They returned "home" to Tower Hamlets and the Newham Leisure Centre, although their first two seasons yielded just three League victories.
It was 1991 when the franchise which came to sit astride British basketball finally gained its most well-known label. Renamed London Towers, but still playing at Newham the club's fortunes turned around in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20British%20Basketball%20League%20season">1991-92 season</a>, as they finished fourth, and a move to the Sobell Sports Centre in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> saw them finish third in 1993. In 1994 they moved to <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a>, and it was there that they enjoyed their best seasons, winning five titles in two seasons, from 1995 to 1997.
The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20British%20Basketball%20League%20season">1997-98</a> season saw the Towers make the European debut appearance, competing in the <a href="Saporta%20Cup">EuroCup</a>, however all did not go to plan and the London team were shamed with a 1-9 record in Group E, finishing in last place. The Towers made another appearance in Europe in 2001 when they took part in the prestigious <a href="Euroleague">Euroleague</a>, but again the Towers collapsed with a 0-14 record, good enough only for 8th place in Group B.
Once more though, in 1998 the Towers home venue proved too expensive and the team moved out of Wembley, "merging" with fellow BBL team <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20Basketball">Crystal Palace</a> and splitting games between the two arenas until in 1999 they moved full-time to the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace National Sports Centre</a>.
In 2005, the Towers launched a second team, London Towers II, in the <a href="English%20Basketball%20League">English Basketball League</a> as a stepping-stone for their development players. In their first season in Division 3, the team finished runners-up.
Plans for their own Arena, linking with their community and development work, had been rumoured for several years but in 2006, the London Towers first team pulled out of <a href="British%20Basketball%20League">BBL</a>, for a "one year break". As a result, the second team London Towers II continued to fly the flag, competing in the <a href="English%20Basketball%20League">English Basketball League</a> Division 3 while still operating all of is youth and development teams. Such a step had also been taken in the past by both <a href="Manchester%20Giants">Manchester Giants</a> (see <a href="Manchester%20Magic">Manchester Magic</a>) and <a href="Derby%20Storm">Derby Storm</a> (see <a href="Derby%20Trailblazers">Derby Trailblazers</a>) and neither has yet returned to the top league.
The deadline for entry into the 2009-2010 English Basketball League had closed and London Towers failed to submit a team, therefore there will be no senior men's London Towers team for the foreseeable future.

The Daintree Rainforest is a <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a> region on the north east coast of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia north of <a href="Mossman%2C%20Queensland">Mossman</a> and <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>. At around , the Daintree is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the <a href="Australia%20%28continent%29">Australian continent</a>. Along the coastline north of the <a href="Daintree%20River">Daintree River</a>, tropical rainforest grows right down to the edge of the sea.
The rainforest is named after <a href="Richard%20Daintree">Richard Daintree</a>, an Australian geologist and photographer (1832-1878).
The area includes the Daintree National Park, some areas of State Forest, and some privately owned land, including a residential community of upwards of 5 people. Some of the privately owned land north of the Peninsula Range is being progressively purchased for conservation purposes under a $15 government scheme involving equal contributions from the municipal (<a href="Cairns%20Regional%20Council">Cairns Regional Council</a>, which includes the former Douglas Shire council), State (<a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>) and <a href="Australian%20Federal%20Government">Australian Federal governments</a>. As of May 2011, 72% of the properties earmarked for buyback or compensation had been secured. These 'buyback' areas of tropical rainforest included 215 blocks of land purchased by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, and 13 purchased by private conservation agencies.
The Daintree Rainforest contains 3% of the <a href="frog">frog</a>, <a href="reptile">reptile</a> and <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> species in Australia, and 90% of Australia's <a href="bat">bat</a> and <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> species. 7% of <a href="bird">bird</a> species in the country can be found in this area. There are also over 12,000 species of insects in the rainforest. All of this <a href="Biodiversity">diversity</a> is contained within an area that takes up 0.1% of the <a href="landmass">landmass</a> of Australia. Part of the forest is protected by the <a href="Daintree%20National%20Park">Daintree National Park</a> and drained by the <a href="Daintree%20River">Daintree River</a>. The roads north of the river wind through areas of lush forest, and have been designed to minimize impacts on this ancient ecosystem.
The tropical rainforest ecosystem of the Daintree Rainforest is one of the most complex on Earth. Its plant diversity and structural complexity is unrivalled on the Australian continent and represents the origins of its more familiar ‘Australian’ flora.
Millions of years ago, the Australian continent was warm and humid and rainfall was plentiful. During this time rainforest thrived in places such as the Ayers Rock region. As Australia became more arid, there were fewer and fewer places rainforests were able to survive. In the Daintree region, however the climate and topography were ideal, so the area became a last remaining refuge for rainforest. Within this refuge many species were able to live comfortably without reason to change. Their descendants that are still living today retained many of their ancestors' primitive characteristics, some dating back 110 million years.
One species in particular, <a href="Idiospermum">"Idiospermum australiense"</a>, commonly known as the idiot fruit, is one of the rarest and most primitive of the flowering plants. Its discovery in 1970 was arguably Australia’s most significant botanical find, greatly increasing scientists awareness of just how ancient these forests really are. 
From a total of 19 primitive flowering plant families on Earth, 12 families are represented in the Daintree region making the highest concentration of these plants worldwide. These ancient plant families may well hold the secret to a number of unanswered questions regarding the origins of the flowering plants – plants on which the human race depends for food and medicines.
Besides all the scientific interest within this Daintree region there are many natural and often unique features to be explored. The landscape is one of striking diversity including magnificent scenery, mountain ranges, fast flowing streams and waterfalls, deep gorges and dense rainforest.
There is outstanding coastal scenery that combines tropical rainforest, white sandy beaches and fringing reefs just offshore. This is an extremely rare combination.
To the west of Cape Tribulation stands Mt Pieter Botte with its massive granite outcrops. The summit providing expansive vistas of undisturbed forest and to the south the skyline is dominated by the giant granite boulders of Thornton Peak – one of Queensland’s highest mountains.

Michael Denis

Johann Nepomuk Cosmas Michael Denis, also: "Sined the Bard", (27 September 1729 – 29 September 1800) was an Austrian <a href="Catholic%20priest">Catholic priest</a> and <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a>, who is best known as a poet, <a href="bibliographer">bibliographer</a>, and <a href="lepidopterist">lepidopterist</a>.
Denis was born at <a href="Sch%C3%A4rding">Schärding</a>, located on the <a href="Inn%20%28river%29">Inn River</a>, then ruled by the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Electorate of Bavaria</a>, in 1729, the son of Johann Rudolph Denis, who taught him Latin at an early age. At the age of ten, he was enrolled to be educated by the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a> at their college in <a href="Passau">Passau</a>. After completing his studies in 1747, he entered the <a href="novitiate">novitiate</a> of the Society of Jesus in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.
In 1749, following this initial formation period, Denis was sent to carry his period of <a href="regency%20%28Jesuit%29">Regency</a> at Jesuit colleges in <a href="Graz">Graz</a> and <a href="Klagenfurt">Klagenfurt</a>. He was <a href="Holy%20Orders">ordained</a> a <a href="Catholic%20priest">priest</a> in 1757. Two years later, he was appointed professor at the <a href="Theresianum">Theresianum</a> in Vienna, a Jesuit college. After the <a href="suppression%20of%20the%20Jesuits">suppression of the Jesuits</a> in 1773, and the subsequent closing of the college, he remained there to maintain its library until 1784, at which time he was made second custodian of the library of the royal court, and seven years later became its chief librarian.
Denis died in Vienna in 1800.
A warm admirer of <a href="Friedrich%20Gottlieb%20Klopstock">Klopstock</a>, Denis was one of the leading members of the group of so-called <a href="bard">bard</a>s; and his original <a href="poetry">poetry</a>, published under the title "Die Lieder Sineds des Barden" (1772), shows all the extravagances of the bardic movement. He is best remembered as the translator of <a href="Ossian">Ossian</a> (1768–1769; also published together with his own poems in 5 vols. as "Ossians und Sineds Lieder", 1784).
More important than either Denis' original poetry or his translations were his efforts to familiarize the Austrians with the literature of <a href="Northern%20Germany">Northern Germany</a>; his "Sammlung kürzerer Gedichte aus den neuern Dichtern Deutschlands", 3 vols. (1762–1766), was in this respect invaluable. He has also left a number of bibliographical compilations, "Grundriss der Bibliographie und Bücherkunde" (1774), "Grundriss der Literaturgeschichte" (1776), "Einleitung in die Bücherkunde" (1777), and "Wiens Buchdruckergeschichte bis 1560" (1782).
"Ossians und Sineds Lieder" have not been reprinted since 1791; but a selection of Denis' poetry, edited by Richard Hamel, is to found in volume 48 (1884) of "Kürschners Deutsche Nationalliteratur". His "<a href="Nachlass">Literarischer Nachlass</a>" was published by <a href="Joseph%20Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Retzer">Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Retzer</a> in 1802 (2 vols), two years after Denis had died in Vienna, aged 71.
In addition to his literary output, working with <a href="Ignaz%20Schifferm%C3%BCller">Ignaz Schiffermüller</a>, Denis formed an early collection of <a href="butterfly">butterflies</a> and <a href="moth">moth</a>s, and published the first catalog of the <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> found around Vienna. His collection was kept at the <a href="Hofburg%20Palace">Hofburg Palace</a> and was destroyed in course of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Austrian%20Empire">Revolution of 1848</a>

The Omaha World-Herald is the primary daily newspaper of Nebraska and portions of southwest <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>. It is based in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. For decades it circulated daily throughout Nebraska and in parts of Kansas, South Dakota, Missouri, Colorado and Wyoming. In 2008, distribution was reduced to the eastern third of Nebraska and western Iowa.
"The World-Herald" was the largest employee-owned newspaper in the United States. On November 30, 2011, <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>'s <a href="Berkshire%20Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a> announced plans to buy the newspaper.
It is the only remaining major metropolitan newspaper in the United States to publish both morning and afternoon editions. The newspaper publishes four daily editions, with three morning editions (regional; Lincoln, Neb.; and metropolitan) and one afternoon edition (metropolitan). Its market area spans two time zones and is more than 500 miles across.
"The World-Herald" had for many years been the newspaper with the highest penetration rate – the percentage of people who subscribe to the publication within the paper's home circulation area – in the United States.
The Omaha World-Herald Company also operates the website <a href="http%3A//www.omaha.com">Omaha.com</a>, the region's most popular website by all measures of traffic. The site has more than 300,000 registered users and more than 14 million page views monthly. Its website and newspaper combined reach 85.3 percent of the Omaha market, the second-highest percentage of people within a home circulation area compared with other major metropolitan newspapers in the United States.
The company dubs its downtown Omaha headquarters the <a href="Freedom%20Center%20%28Omaha%29">Freedom Center</a>. The John Gottschalk Freedom Center also houses its three printing presses, which can each print 75,000 papers per hour, and are considered to be some of the most advanced in the world. In 2006, the company purchased the 16-story former <a href="Northwestern%20Bell">Northwestern Bell</a>/<a href="Qwest%20Communications">Qwest Communications</a> building in <a href="downtown%20Omaha">downtown Omaha</a> as a new base for its news, editorial, circulation and business operations.
The newspaper has bureaus in Lincoln, Neb., and Washington, D.C. Throughout the region, "The World-Herald" also owns smaller daily and weekly newspapers, which contribute to its World-Herald News Service.
Through the World Publishing Co., the former name of the newspaper's parent company, "The World-Herald" owned Omaha television station <a href="KETV">KETV</a> from its founding in 1957. (The station was dubbed "Omaha World-Herald" television.) Because of a change in <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> law, "The World-Herald" had to divest the station in 1976. It sold the station to the now-defunct Pulitzer Broadcasting Co., of St. Louis, which merged with the <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst Corporation</a> in 1998 and is the station's current owner.
"The World-Herald" has won three <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>s, including the esteemed <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Public%20Service">Pulitzer Prize for Public Service</a>, awarded in 1943.
The newspaper was founded in 1885 by <a href="Gilbert%20M.%20Hitchcock">Gilbert M. Hitchcock</a> as the "Omaha Evening World". It was absorbed by <a href="George%20L.%20Miller">George L. Miller</a>'s "Omaha Herald" in 1889. The paper was established as an independent political voice but quickly moved to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> column. <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> was its editor in 1894-96. Hitchcock served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and, starting in 1911, two Senate terms. It was a more objective voice than the "<a href="Omaha%20Bee">Omaha Bee</a>", which tended to sensationalize news to drum up sales.
His son-in-law, <a href="Henry%20Doorly">Henry Doorly</a>, took control of the paper after Hitchcock's death in 1934. The editorial page began leaning <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> after Hitchcock's death. Over his lifetime, Doorly served 58 years at the paper.
In 1963, the World Publishing Company, owned solely by heirs of the Hitchcock/Doorly families, sold "The World-Herald" to local businessman <a href="Peter%20Kiewit">Peter Kiewit</a>, a construction magnate whose namesake company is a member of the <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a>. When he died, Kiewit left provisions to ensure that the paper would remain locally owned, with a large part of the plan securing employee ownership.
On November 30, 2011, the "Omaha World-Herald" announced that <a href="Berkshire%20Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a> will buy the newspaper pending a vote by its shareholders which is made up of active employees, retired employees and the Peter Kiewit Foundation.

John Waters (director born 1893)

John Waters (October 31, 1893 – May 5, 1965) was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="film%20director">film director</a>, <a href="second%20unit%20director">second unit director</a> and earlier an <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a> whose career began in the early days of <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> and culminated in two consecutive <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations in the newly instituted category of <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Assistant%20Director">Best Assistant Director</a>, with the second nomination, for <a href="MGM">MGM</a>'s "<a href="Viva%20Villa%21">Viva Villa!</a>", winning him an Oscar statuette at the <a href="7th%20Academy%20Awards">7th Academy Awards</a> on February 27, 1935.
A native of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, John Waters entered the motion picture industry in its formative years. Only a few of his assistant director credits from the 1910s have been recorded, with vehicles for <a href="Carlyle%20Blackwell">Carlyle Blackwell</a> ("The Shadow of a Doubt", 1916) and <a href="Harold%20Lockwood">Harold Lockwood</a> ("The Avenging Trail", 1917) listed among the earliest titles. During this initial phase of his career, he was billed on at least two occasions as John S. Waters and on at least one occasion as Johnnie Waters.
In 1926 he was offered a position as director with <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a> and, over a two-year period, turned out ten films, five of which ("Born to the West", "Forlorn River", "Man of the Forest", "The Mysterious Rider" and "The Vanishing Pioneer") were based on the series of popular <a href="western%20fiction">western fiction</a> novels by <a href="Zane%20Grey">Zane Grey</a> and starred Famous Players' reigning western hero, <a href="Jack%20Holt%20%28actor%29">Jack Holt</a>. There were two additional Zane Grey adaptations, "Drums of the Desert" (starring <a href="Warner%20Baxter">Warner Baxter</a>) and "<a href="Nevada%20%281927%20film%29">Nevada</a>", while an eighth western, 1927's "Arizona Bound", Waters' sole sagebrush saga not based on Zane Grey, starred Gary Cooper in his first leading role. Although he did not direct Cooper's second starring western, "The Last Outlaw", the new star's third lead western, "Nevada", was once again assigned to Waters, along with another Cooper vehicle, the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a> saga, "<a href="Beau%20Sabreur">Beau Sabreur</a>", a sequel to Famous Players' biggest hit of 1926, "<a href="Beau%20Geste%20%281926%20film%29">Beau Geste</a>", which starred <a href="Ronald%20Colman">Ronald Colman</a>. Rounding out Waters' ten assignments was a single comedy, the <a href="W.%20C.%20Fields">W. C. Fields</a>-<a href="Chester%20Conklin">Chester Conklin</a> vehicle, "Two Flaming Youths", which he also produced. In 1928, a few months after Famous Players-Lasky's September 1927 reorganization under the name Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation, Waters left the studio to begin a lengthy sojourn with MGM, where his initial directorial assignments consisted of two <a href="Tim%20McCoy">Tim McCoy</a> series westerns, "The Overland Telegraph" and "Sioux Blood" which, when released in March and April 1929, respectively, were among MGM's last silent features.
At this point, as the <a href="Sound%20film">talkie revolution</a> transformed Hollywood, Waters, now an MGM contractee, returned to his former profession as assistant director, an industry job title which, during a brief period covering five Academy Award cycles (1932–33 to 1937), became eligible for an Oscar. On March 16, 1934, at the first Awards ceremony featuring the new category, John Waters was among eighteen nominees who were singled out for the totality of their achievement at the studio which employed them, rather than for a single feature. Each studio had two or three nominees, with <a href="Charles%20Dorian">Charles Dorian</a> and <a href="Orville%20O.%20Dull">Orville O. Dull</a> rounding out, along with Waters, the MGM contingent. Ultimately, there were seven winners that year, one of them Dorian. The following year, after considerable streamlining, the nominations were pared down to three and categorized according to each nominee's work on a specific film. Only John Waters, among the previous year's eighteen nominees, was renominated, as his contribution to <a href="Wallace%20Beery">Wallace Beery</a>'s portrayal of Mexican revolutionary leader <a href="Pancho%20Villa">Pancho Villa</a> won against two <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>-<a href="Warren%20William">Warren William</a> titles represented by assistant directors <a href="Scott%20Beal">Scott Beal</a> ("<a href="Imitation%20of%20Life%20%281934%20film%29">Imitation of Life</a>") and <a href="Cullen%20Tate">Cullen Tate</a> ("<a href="Cleopatra%20%281934%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>").
Although known in the industry, Waters, along with other studio-employed assistant directors and second unit directors, did not have his name listed in the credits of "Viva Villa!" as well a great majority of the other titles for which he fulfilled those functions. Other than a 1935 one-reel <a href="Pete%20Smith%20%28film%20producer%29">Pete Smith Specialty</a>, "Donkey Baseball", his sole directorial assignment in the sound era was "<a href="The%20Mighty%20McGurk">The Mighty McGurk</a>", MGM's 1946 vehicle for his old "Viva Villa!" compatriot, Wallace Beery.
Twelve years later, after working as second unit director on two big-budget 1958 releases, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner</a>'s "<a href="The%20Deep%20Six">The Deep Six</a>" and the independently produced "<a href="The%20Big%20Country">The Big Country</a>", John Waters was admitted as a patient to the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Country%20House%20and%20Hospital">Motion Picture Country House and Hospital</a> in the <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> suburb of <a href="Woodland%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Woodland Hills</a>, where he died seven years later at the age of 71. "The New York Times" obituary, under the heading "John S. Waters", described him as "a pioneer motion picture director" who "was 70 years old", and stated that "his widow, Frances, survives".

Crow's nest

A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">main mast</a> of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point.
This position ensured the best view for <a href="lookout">lookout</a>s to spot approaching hazards, other ships, or land. It was the best device for this purpose until the invention of <a href="radar">radar</a>.
In the early 19th century, it was simply a <a href="barrel">barrel</a> or a <a href="basket">basket</a> lashed to the tallest mast. Later, it became a specially designed platform with protective railing. The barrel crow's nest was invented in 1807 by the Arctic explorer William Scoresby, Sr. A statue in <a href="Whitby%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Whitby, North Yorkshire</a> commemorates the event.
It should not be confused with the <a href="top%20%28sailing%20ship%29">top</a>, the platform in the upper part of each lower mast of a <a href="square-rigged">square-rigged</a> <a href="sailing%20ship">sailing ship</a>.
The first recorded appearance of the term was in 1807, used to describe William Scoresby's barrel crows nest platform. According to a popular naval legend, the term derives from the practice of <a href="Viking">Viking</a> sailors, who carried <a href="crow">crow</a>s or <a href="raven">raven</a>s in a cage secured to the top of the mast. In cases of poor visibility, a crow was released, and the navigator plotted a course corresponding to the bird's flight path because the crow invariably headed towards the nearest land. However, other naval scholars have found no evidence of the masthead crow cage and suggest the name was coined because Scoresby's lookout platform resembled a crow's nest in a tree.
Sometimes, the term is used <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>ically in reference to topmost structures in buildings, <a href="tower">tower</a>s, etc.
Since the crow's nest is a point far away from the ship's <a href="centre%20of%20mass">centre of mass</a>, any small movement of the ship is amplified and could lead to severe <a href="seasickness">seasickness</a>, even in accustomed sailors. Therefore, being sent to the crow's nest was also considered a punishment. 
In classic <a href="railroad">railroad</a> <a href="train">train</a>s, the box-like structure above the <a href="caboose">caboose</a>, the <a href="cupola">cupola</a>, was also called the crow's nest. It served for observation of the whole train when in motion.
In <a href="hunting">hunting</a>, a crow's nest is a blind-like structure where a hunter or a pair of hunters commit themselves to stalking game. A crow's nest is not a normal type of purchasable blind, but an improvised position, built by using locally discovered natural <a href="flora">flora</a> (tree branches, moss, snow (during winter) or sand (during summer), etc.). A crow's nest works in most environments and provides a good lookout point (hence the name) when built in an elevated position like a hillside or top of a hill.

Asiya

Asiya (<a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>: آسية), also known as Asiya bint Muzahim, is revered by Muslims as one of the greatest 
women of all time, other three are <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> (mother of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>), <a href="Khadija%20bint%20Khuwaylid">Khadija</a> (wife of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>) and <a href="Fatimah">Fatimah</a> (daughter of Muhammad). She was the wife of <a href="Pharaohs%20in%20the%20Bible%23Pharaohs%20in%20the%20Book%20of%20Exodus">the Pharaoh</a> (in Arabic pronounced "Fir'awn"), who reigned during <a href="Moses">Moses</a>'s (Arabic: <a href="Moses%20in%20Islam">Musa</a>) time. The <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> chronicles her as a great person and she is respected all the more by Muslims as she was married to a man said to be one of the most evil men in history, but never lost faith in <a href="God%20in%20Islam">God</a> and remained steadfast in prayer and belief. She declared her faith in the message of God after witnessing the miracle of Moses in the Court of Pharaoh and after witnessing the death of another believing woman under torture. Pharaoh tried to turn her away from the God of Moses and sought her mother's help. But Asiya refused to reject the God of Moses. On Pharaoh's order, she was tortured to death.
In Arabic the name Asiya has many meanings. It can mean the pillar, mediator, supporter, sorrow lifter, and sorrow helper.
Asiya was the wife of the Pharaoh. Unlike her evil husband, she was a pious and believing woman who accepted the faith that <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a> were preaching. Although she had exceeding wealth, she was not arrogant like the Pharaoh. She realized that faith in <a href="God">God</a> was far more important and was thus exalted by God amongst the women of her generation.
Asiya and her maids were at the neighbouring <a href="Nile%20river">Nile river</a> one day. To their amazement, they found a crate floating in the river. Asiya immediately ordered the crate to be brought out on shore. Although the maids thought there was a treasure in the crate, they in fact found a baby boy inside. Asiya instantly fell in love with him and knew that this boy, <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, was no ordinary baby. She told the Pharaoh about the baby and convinced her husband to allow the baby to live with them. The wife of Pharaoh said: "(Here is) joy of the eye, for me and for thee: slay him not. It may be that he will be use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not (what they were doing)! (Qur'an 28:9)
Asiya then offered Moses' mother to live in their household as Moses' <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a> and paid her for her services, being unaware that the wet nurse was Moses' mother. 
Thus, mother and son were reunited again.
The tradition holds that Asiya worshipped God in secret and praying in disguise fearing her husband. She died while being tortured by her husband, who had discovered her monotheism.
It is said that Asiya was a sincere believer and that she fully submitted herself to <a href="Allah">Allah</a> , despite being the wife of Pharaoh. According to Hadith, she will be among the first women to enter Paradise because she accepted Moses's monotheism over Pharaoh's beliefs. The <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> mentions Asiya as an example to all Muslims

Royal Malay Regiment

The Royal Malay Regiment (; <a href="Jawi%20script">Jawi</a>: ريجيمن عسكر ملايو دراج) is the premier unit of the <a href="Malaysian%20Army">Malaysian Army</a>'s two <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="regiments">regiments</a>. At its largest, the Malay Regiment comprised 27 battalions. At present, two battalions are parachute trained and form part of the Malaysian Army Rapid Deployment Force. Another battalion has been converted into a <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> battalion while the remaining battalions are standard light infantry. The 1st Battalion Royal Malay Regiment acts as the ceremonial battalion for the <a href="Yang%20di-Pertuan%20Agong">High King of Malaysia</a>, and is usually accompanied by the Central Band of the Royal Malay Regiment. As its name suggests, the regiment only recruits ethnic <a href="Malays%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malays</a>.
Beginning in 1902, Malay rulers led by <a href="Iskandar%20of%20Perak">Sultan Alang Iskandar Shah</a> (<a href="Sultan%20of%20Perak">Sultan of Perak</a>), Tuanku Muhamad Ibni Yam Tuan Antah (<a href="Negeri%20Sembilan">Negeri Sembilan</a>), <a href="Raja%20Chulan">Raja Chulan</a> (Perak Royal Family), and <a href="Dato%20Abdullah%20Haji%20Dahan">Dato Abdullah Haji Dahan</a> (Undang Luak Rembau) urged the British colonial office to raise an army regiment from the local population. At the time, various <a href="British%20Army">British</a> and <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> battalions (including the <a href="Burma%20Rifles">Burma Rifles</a>) provided security for the Malay States.
On 23 November 1932 the British <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> approved the formation of the Malay Regiment as a locally raised regiment of the British Army then on 23 January 1933, the Federal Consultative Council passed the Malay Regiment Act as Act No. 11. Funding of $70,000 was also approved for the purchase of the Kong Sang Rubber Estate in <a href="Port%20Dickson">Port Dickson</a> for use as the Recruit Training Centre.
The regiment traces its origin back to 1933 and the 1st Experimental Company, a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of native Malays established as the beginning of a native military force in <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>. On 1 February 1933, 25 young Malay locals were chosen from 1,000 applicants as suitable recruits for the new regiment. Formed on 1 March 1933 in the Haig Lines, Port Dickson, <a href="Negeri%20Sembilan">Negeri Sembilan</a>, this Experimental Company began with the 25 recruits under Commanding Officer G. McBruce and <a href="Adjutant">Adjutant</a> Captain K. G. Exham. The Regimental Sergeant Major was A. E. McCarthy, and E. Oldfiled served as Quartermaster Sergeant.
At this stage, because the 'Company' was only an attempt to "find out how the Malays would react to military discipline". it was designated "Experimental". On 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became the Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. Recruitment then accelerated, and a further 232 recruits were formed into two <a href="rifle%20company">rifle companies</a>, as well as a headquarters wing that included a <a href="Vickers%20machine-gun">Vickers machine-gun</a> platoon, a Signalling Section, and a Corps of Drums. As of 1 January 1938, the 1st Battalion Malay Regiment had a complement of 17 British officers, six Malay officers, 11 Warrant Officers, and 759 non-commissioned officers and other ranks. Training intensified
as the shadow of war loomed larger with frequent long route marches and exercises at battalion and brigade levels. The regiment also began training with mortars and anti-tank weapons. In August 1941, a <a href="Bren%20gun%20carrier">Bren gun carrier</a> platoon was formed under Captain R. R. C. Carter and trained with the British 2nd Loyals Regiment. In March 1941, the Colonial Governor of the Straits Settlements, authorised the increase of the regiment's strength to two battalions with the creation of The 2nd Battalion in 1941. The two battalions of the Malay Regiment, along with the 2nd Battalion <a href="The%20Loyal%20Regiment%20%28North%20Lancashire%29">The Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)</a>, formed the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade and went on to play a major role in the defence of Malaya during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.
Company A of 2nd Battalion was the first Malay Regiment unit to engage Japanese forces landing at Kampung Salak in <a href="Pengkalan%20Chepa">Pengkalan Chepa</a>, <a href="Kelantan">Kelantan</a>. Outnumbered, the unit eventually withdrew to <a href="Kuala%20Krai">Kuala Krai</a>, and later to Singapore.
The first clash between the Malay Regiment and Japanese soldiers occurred on 13 February 1942 at around 1400 hrs when the Japanese 18th Division attacked the south-western coast along the <a href="Pasir%20Panjang">Pasir Panjang</a> Ridge and across Ayer Rajah Road. That morning, the Japanese 56th Infantry Regiment, with considerable artillery support, attacked. 'B' Company of 1st Battalion, Malay Regiment, defending their position on the ridge came under heavy fire from Japanese troops supported by artillery and tanks and were forced to retreat to the rear. However, before their withdrawal was complete, the Japanese broke through 'B'Company's position and encircled the entire company. When their ammunition ran out, 'B' Company troops fought savagely in hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. Captain Yazid Ahmad of the Federated Malay States Volunteer Force, on secondment to the Malay Regiment, took over 'B' Company due to mounting officer casualties and led them in a heroic and glorious last stand eclipsing the later achievements of 2nd Lieutenant <a href="Adnan%20Saidi">Adnan Saidi</a>. Captain Yazid died where he stood at the head of his men. A few soldiers from 'B' Company managed to break out from the encirclement while other survivors were captured and became prisoners-of-war. The destruction of 'B' Company led to the night withdrawal of both the 44th Indian and 1st Malaya Brigade to the general line running from Mount Echo (at the junction of Ayer Rajah and Depot Road) to Buona Vista.
On 14 February, the Japanese launched a further heavy attack at 0830 hours, supported by intense mortar and artillery fire, on the front held by the 1st Malaya infantry Brigade. The fighting included bitter hand-to-hand combat with heavy losses on both sides. At 1600 hours, an attack supported by tanks eventually succeeded in penetrating the left flank where the defenders were forced back to a line from the junction of the Ayer Rajah and Depot Road through the Brick Works and along the canal to Bukit Chermin. Owing to the failure of units on both its flanks to hold their ground, the 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade withdrew at 1430 hours. At this point, the Malay Regiment's C Company were ordered to move to a new defence position, Pt. 226 at <a href="Bukit%20Chandu">Bukit Chandu</a> (Opium Hill).
Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi and his men of 7 Platoon, C Company of the 1st Bn Malay Regiment made their well-known final stand against the Japanese attack on Opium Hill, now being cemorated as <a href="Reflections%20at%20Bukit%20Chandu">Reflections at Bukit Chandu</a>. Adnan Saidi's bravery was exemplified in the battle where he was killed along with many of his Malay Regiment soldiers in the last defensive battle at Pasir Panjang. His motto "Biar Putih Tulang Jangan Putih Mata" is still remembered. The translation loosely means, "it is better to die fighting than to live crying in regret till the eyes becomes blind." In other words, "Death Before Dishonour".
Had the Japanese gained control of Opium Hill and the ridge that overlooked the north of the island, it would have given them direct passage to the Alexandra area where the British army had its main ammunition and supply depots, a military hospital and other key installations.
Separated from D Company by a big canal on fire with oil flowing from Normanton Depot, C Company were prevented from retreating further south. C Company Commander Captain Rix died during the early part of the engagement whereupon command automatically passed to Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi.
The Japanese troops pressed their attack on Opium Hill in the afternoon. Using deception, they sent a group of soldiers dressed in Punjabi uniforms to pass themselves off as <a href="Punjabi%20people">Punjabi</a> soldiers from the British army. However, Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi saw through the ruse as British soldiers march in threes and Japanese soldiers march in fours. When the disguised soldiers reached the Malay Regiment's defence line, C Company's squad opened fire with their <a href="Lewis%20Gun">Lewis machine guns</a>, killing some of the Japanese troops and badly wounding the rest — those who survived rolled and crawled downhill to save themselves. Four of the top marksmen in the previous years military competition held in Singapore were men from C Company.
Two hours later, the Japanese launched an all-out assault in great numbers despite being within point blank range of the Australian artillery. To save ammunition, the artillery did not open fire, a move that greatly surprised the Japanese army. The shell that had been "saved" by the Australian artillery was handed over to the Japanese army the next day when General Percival surrendered Singapore to General Yamashita.
The Malay Regiment were soon overwhelmed by the attack. Although greatly outnumbered and short of ammunition and supplies, they continued to put up resistance. Reports claimed that Second Lieutenant Adnan Saidi manned a Lewis machine gun against the Japanese troops while some soldiers engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat using bayonets. Nevertheless, the troops stood their ground and frustrated the enemy. Adnan Saidi was seriously wounded but refused to retreat and instead encouraged his men to fight to the last, showing a disregard for danger that inspired the company to fight on. Second Lieutenant Adnan was later captured and tortured before being bayoneted to death.
On 28 February 1942, four Malay Regiment officers taken prisoner were executed in Pasir Panjang by firing squad for refusing to join the Imperial Japanese Army at the urging of Malay traitor Major Mustapha Hussein of the "<a href="F%20Kikan">Fujiwara Kikan</a>" Japanese intelligence organisation. They were Lieutenant (No.8) Ariffin Hj Sulaiman, Lieutenant (No.29) Abdul Wahid Jidin, Lieutenant (No.57) Abdullah Saad and Lieutenant (No.12) Ibrahim Sidek. Lieutenant Ahmad Noordin of 'A' Company, 1st Battalion was executed earlier on 15 February 1942 while Lieutenant Muhammad Isa Mahmud of HQ Company, 1st Battalion was executed on 12 February 1942. Most of the surviving captured Malay Regiment officers defected and joined the Imperial Japanese Army.
During the entire <a href="Battle%20of%20Malaya">Malayan Campaign</a>, but largely between 12–14 February 1942 in Singapore, the Malay Regiment suffered a total of 159 killed (six British officers, seven Malay officers, and 146 other ranks) and a large but unspecified number wounded. On the whole the British were not convinced that the Malays were a martial race in view of the widespread desertions among Malay Volunteer troops leading to most of the remaining Malay Volunteers being disarmed before they entered Johor and were ordered home. A small core of well trained and loyal Malay Volunteer officers and NCOs fought to the end in the defence of Singapore.
The <a href="British%20Military%20Administration%20%28Malaya%29">British Military Administration</a> recommended a quick restruction of the Malay Regiment in 1946, and mooted the idea of opening its recruitment to all races. This would then have created a racially integrated regiment, along the political lines of fusing the states of <a href="Malayan%20Union">Malaya</a>, while a multi-racial Malay regiment was seen as a potential unifying force in post war Malaya. However, the proposal met with bitter opposition from the Malay Rulers and the population at large, and was seen as a link to British efforts to erode Malay supremacy ("<a href="Ketuanan%20Melayu">Ketuanan Melayu</a>"), a key feature of the <a href="Malayan%20Union">Malayan Union</a>.
By mid 1946, the idea of a multi-racial Malay Regiment had been dropped. The all-Malay Malay Regiment would become part of a Federation Army of <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisional</a> strength thereby freeing up British regiments for other more strategic duties. The British plan to develop a strategic reserve of three brigades held in Britain would require the raising of more local regiments.
The Overseas Defence Committee thereafter endorsed a gradual expansion of the Malay Regiment to six battalions by 1950 whereby the Malay Regiment would be used mainly for internal security, with multi-racial formations in the supporting arms.
By 1948, the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> had seven partially reformed <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a> battalions in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a>, in addition to two battalions of the Malay Regiment. By mid 1948, only three British battalions remained in Malaya to provide security to the Federation. The Malay Regiment also played a major role against the <a href="Communists">Communists</a> during the emergency when an eventual seven battalions served during the Emergency, with the 3rd battalion raised in 1948.
The regiment gained the 'royal' prefix in 1960, becoming the Royal Malay Regiment and by 1961 had a strength of 11 Battalions. It's Sovereign's Colour was later received in 1963.
During the confrontation, the Royal Malay Regiment were also deployed in Sabah and Sarawak. During this deployment, the Kalabakan incident occurred on 29 December 1963. An outpost in Kalabakan in <a href="Tawau">Tawau</a>, established and manned by members of C Company of the 3rd Battalion under the command of Maj Zainal Abidin bin Haji Yaacob was ambushed by "volunteers" of the North Kalimantan Army while performing their Maghrib prayers. The company reacted and stood to, and were finally able to repel the attacking force. However, seven members of the company, including Major Zainal Abidin were killed and 16 others wounded.
The 4th Bn Royal Malay Regiment under the command of Lt Kol Ungku Nazaruddin formed the core of the Malayan Special Force that served under UN command in the Congo in 1960. In turn, the 6th Bn Royal Malay, 7th Bn Royal Malay and 2nd Bn Royal Malay also served in the Congo under UN command. 2nd Bn Royal Malay ended the Congo deployment on 28 April 1963 when they returned home.
As part of the United Nations <a href="UNOSOM%20II">UNOSOM II</a> operation in Somalia, the 19th Bn Royal Malay Regiment (Mechanised) started deployment of its 870 members in Mogadishu from 18 June 1993. The battalion was involved in the combat rescue of US Army <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Rangers">Rangers</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mogadishu%20%281993%29">Battle of Mogadishu</a>, where the Battalion provided the <a href="Condor%20%28APC%29">Radpanzer Condor</a> <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s for the QRF force of the <a href="10th%20Mountain%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">10th Mountain Division</a> that effected the rescue. One member of the battalion, a driver of one of the APCs, Private Mat Aznan (posthumously promoted to Corporal) was killed and four APCs destroyed during the rescue.
23rd Bn Royal Malay and 3rd Armour formed MALBATT I as part of the United Nations Protection Force and started deployment in September 1993. 23 Bn Royal Malay served until August 1994 and were replaced by MALBATT II comprising 5 Bn Royal Malay and 2nd Armour. MALBATT III (28 March 1995 – November 1995) was formed from 12 Bn Royal Malay and 1st Armour. Malcon 1 (2 Royal Ranger Regiment &amp; 4th Armour), Malcon 2 (18 RMR &amp; 2nd Armour), Malcon 4 (2 RMR &amp; 1 Armour)
The Regiment's crest depicts a pair of tigers supporting an Oriental Crown. Within the circle of the crest are a <a href="kris">kris</a> and a scabbard with the Regimental motto "Ta'at Setia" written in Jawi, meaning "Loyal and True". Major G. McI. S. Bruce and Captain K. G. Exham, the founding officers of this Regiment, designed the crest.
Three colours were chosen – green (the Muslim colour), yellow (for Malay royalty) and red (for the British Army influence).
The RAMD has a total of 25 battalions. 20 of these are standard light infantry battalions, with 2 roled as <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> and 2 as parachute infantry. The final battalion is a support unit.
The 1st Bn Royal Malay is the most senior infantry battalion of the Regiment. This was also the battalion group to which Lieutenant <a href="Adnan%20Bin%20Saidi">Adnan Bin Saidi</a> was posted. In 2008, the 1st Battalion became the first all-Muslim unit to provide the <a href="Queen%27s%20Guard">Queen's Guard</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> as well as the first guard from a nation that was not a <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>.
5 Bn Royal Malay regiment is an Allied regiment of the <a href="King%27s%20Own%20Scottish%20Borderers">King's Own Scottish Borderers</a> Regiment of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. The Alliance was formed during 1st Bn KOSB's service in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. Several traditions of KOSB are retained by 5 Bn. The shoulder flash of officers and men of 5 Bn follows the regimental colours of KOSB.
5 Bn also maintains the tradition of having a bagpipe platoon. The tradition started when an officer of KOSB was seconded to 5 Bn Royal Malay in 1953. 5 Bn have just then formed a pipe <a href="platoon">platoon</a>. The Scottish officer introduced the <a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> and helped train the pipers, and the <a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> <a href="platoon">platoon</a> was formed. To this day, the bagpipe platoons of both battalions maintained their alliance. The bagpipe platoon has, in the past, been invited to attend the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>. The last time 5 Bn attended the festival was in January 1990, celebrating the KOSB’s 300th anniversary.
The 6th battalion, Royal Malay Regiment was formed on 1 May 1952 and later deployed to Quetta Camp in Kluang, Johor on 3 November 1952. Though formed on 1 May, the official date for the formation of the battalion is recorded as 3 November 1952. On its formation, the 6th Battalion had British officers from the 1st Battalion of the Dorset and Devonshire Regiment seconded to form the command core of the battalion.
The seconded officers were gradually replaced by Malay officers and in early 1954, 21 of the 26 officers of the battalion consisted of Malay officers replacing their British counterparts. Jeneral (Rtd) Tun Ibrahim Ismail was the first Malay Commanding Officer of the battalion, taking command from 11 August 1958 until 14 June 1960. He later went on to become the first Malay Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces (now called Chief of Defence Forces)
The battalion is a Standard Infantry Battalion of the Malaysian Army. The battalion has participated in the Kris Mere exercises with the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Army">New Zealand Army</a> the battalion was also deployed to The Congo as part of the Malayan Special Force serving under the United Nations Command.
The 17th battalion, Royal Malay Regiment was formed on 1 August 1970. 17 RAMD is the elite forces and one of the PARATROOPER from 10 Brigade Airborne Paratrooper in the Malaysian Army. On 10 October 1994 – 17th PARA undertakes a rapid deployment exercise, supported by elements of the Malaysian Special Forces Group (Gerup Gerak Khas) and PASKAL and with operational support provided by the Royal Malaysian Navy and Royal Malaysian Air Force. The exercise centres around a scenario of the retaking of Langkawi International Airport from an invading force by the Rapid Deployment Force spearheaded by THE PARA.
<a href="Adnan%20Saidi">Adnan Saidi</a> led the reinforced 42-strong No.7 Platoon of 'C' Company, 1st Battalion of the Malay Regiment at the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) position on 12–14 February 1942. Although heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged his men to fight until the end. They held off the Japanese for two days amid heavy enemy shelling and shortages of food and ammunition. Adnan was shot but carried on fighting. After the battle was lost, the wounded Adnan was taken prisoner by Japanese soldiers, who tied him to a cherry tree and bayoneted him to death. According to some, he was also slashed and his body parts were burnt. Adnan epitomises the bravery and tenacity of the Malay Regiment. Because of this, he is considered a hero by many Malaysians and Singaporeans today.
Based on intelligence gathered indicating that a force of 40 to 50 communist terrorists would converge on Gunung Pueh, “D” Company of 2 Royal Malay Regiment led by Kapten Hamid was tasked in a search and destroy mission.
On 7 April 1973, Kapten Hamid and his company detected a Communist Terrorist encampment. Kapten Hamid organised his company for an assault on the camp. Kapten Hamid fired an M79 grenade round to mark the start of the attack and rushed into the Communist Terrorist camp. In the heat of battle, a communist terrorist tried to shoot down one of Kapten Hamid's men. Kapten Hamid immediately rushed to the terrorist and hit the terrorist in the back of the neck with the <a href="M79%20grenade%20launcher">M79 grenade launcher</a>.
Kapten Hamid’s company scored 3 kills and captured 3 enemy weapons, as well as ammunition and assorted equipment. Kapten Hamid’s company suffered 1 <a href="Killed%20in%20action">KIA</a>. Kapten Hamid was awarded the SP on 6 June 1973.

It is about a <a href="university">university</a> <a href="professor">professor</a> whose research student dies while conducting an experiment. The professor attempts to determine if the death was accident, suicide or murder.
One Thursday afternoon, Professor Brade goes to visit his graduate student's laboratory. He finds Ralph Neufeld dead, having inhaled <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>. In his experiment, he had somehow used <a href="sodium%20cyanide">sodium cyanide</a> instead of <a href="sodium%20acetate">sodium acetate</a>, both white powders. Later, Brade is questioned by Detective Doheny, who is in charge of Ralph's case. When he gets home, he reveals to his wife his suspicions that Ralph's death was murder. She cautions him not to tell this to anyone, as he would destroy any chance of getting <a href="associate%20professor">associate professor</a>ship and <a href="tenure">tenure</a>.
The next day, Brade meets with emeritus professor Cap Anson, who seems to blame him for Ralph's death. They visit the zoo together, and Anson encourages Brade to go into <a href="comparative%20biochemistry">comparative biochemistry</a>. Brade refuses, saying he wants to continue Ralph's work in <a href="chemical%20kinetics">chemical kinetics</a>. Anson tells him that Professor Littleby (head of the chemistry department) has decided not to renew Brade's contract.
On Sunday, Brade reads through Ralph's research notebooks and realizes that Ralph's data had been faked, a cardinal sin in chemistry. When Doheny returns, Brade tells him about the faking, suggesting it as a possible motive for suicide. Doheny, however, twists it around and says that Brade might have been trying to protect his own reputation by hiding the fraud.
The next day Brade again meets with Cap Anson, and immediately afterward in the lab, is almost killed by an oxygen cylinder which has been sabotaged. Now resolved to solve the mystery, he questions Ralph's fiance Roberta Goodhue in the presence of Doheny. She admits that she and Ralph had had an argument about the faked data. The only person who could have overheard was Cap Anson. Brade accuses Anson of killing Ralph to prevent him from publishing the faked data (but does not mention the attempt on his own life). Anson denies the murder, but Doheny then tricks Anson into revealing that he knows about the attempt on Brade's life. Anson confesses to murdering Ralph and attempting to murder Brade.

Archduke Otto of Austria (1865–1906)

Otto Franz Joseph Karl Ludwig Maria, Prince Imperial and Archduke of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia (April 21, 1865 – November 1, 1906) was the second son of <a href="Archduke%20Karl%20Ludwig%20of%20Austria">Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria</a> (younger brother of Emperor <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a>) and his second wife, <a href="Princess%20Maria%20Annunciata%20of%20Bourbon-Two%20Sicilies">Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies</a>. He was the father of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Charles I of Austria</a>, the last Emperor of Austria.
Otto was a son of <a href="Archduke%20Karl%20Ludwig%20of%20Austria">Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria</a> and his wife, <a href="Princess%20Maria%20Annunciata%20of%20Bourbon-Two%20Sicilies">Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies</a>. Otto's father, Karl Ludwig, was a younger brother of Emperor <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a>; and Karl Ludwig became <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> to the Austro-Hungarian throne when his nephew <a href="Rudolf%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Austria">Crown Prince Rudolf</a> died in 1889. Although a newspaper account claimed that Karl Ludwig renounced his rights to the throne that same year (1889) in favour of his eldest son, <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Franz Ferdinand</a> that story is not true. 
On the death of Karl Ludwig in May of 1896, Otto's brother Franz Ferdinand did indeed become heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. At the time of their father's death, Franz Ferdinand had been ill with tuberculosis and there was speculation that Franz Ferdinand would renounce his rights, which would have made his brother, Otto, heir presumptive. However, this did not happen, and Otto was never first in line to the throne.
In 1914, Franz Ferdinand was murdered in Sarajevo, and Otto's son <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Charles</a> became heir presumptive. Charles inherited the throne two years later.
Otto's mother died when he was six years old. Otto and his elder brother Franz Ferdinand were educated by Alfred Ludwig, Baron of Degenfeld. Otto was not interested in learning and often played pranks on his teachers. Nevertheless, his teachers liked the cheerful Otto better than his grumpy and irascible older brother. He was also his father's favourite, which led to a difficult relationship with his brother.
Otto had a reputation as a loafer and was often involved in scandals. He was gradually alienated from the imperial court, and eventually even his wife distanced herself from him.
Around 1900, he contracted <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>. This caused him agonizing pain for the last two years of his life. He withdrew from public life and spent a year in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where he found temporary reprieve. He returned to Austria, where he fell ill again. The last few months of his life, he lived in a villa in the Viennese suburb <a href="W%C3%A4hring">Währing</a>. He was seriously ill, and was nursed by his last mistress, Louise Robinson, using the pseudonym "Sister Martha", and by his stepmother <a href="Infanta%20Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Portugal">Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal</a> (1855-1944). He died on 1 November 1906, in the presence of his spiritual adviser, Godfried Marschall, the <a href="auxiliary%20bishop">auxiliary bishop</a> of Vienna.
After his father's renunciation, his elder brother Franz Ferdinand automatically became heir-presumptive to the throne under the <a href="Line%20of%20succession%20to%20the%20former%20Austro-Hungarian%20throne%23History">Habsburg house laws</a>. There was no need for a special declaration to make him heir presumptive. However, it did not escape the public's attention that the Emperor never commented on his new heir-presumptive. Franz Ferdinand suffered from some serious medical problems, and there were concerns that his health might never allow him to fulfill his rôle as emperor.
In 1896 it was brought to Franz Ferdinand's attention that <a href="Count%20Agenor%20Maria%20Go%C5%82uchowski">Count Gołuchowski</a>, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and of the Imperial and Royal House, had suggested that the emperor, considering Franz Ferdinand's lung disease, might reconsider the line of succession. This led to speculations that Otto might inherit the throne. It was noticed that Otto had more personnel than was usual for an archduke and that he carried out representative tasks that would normally be done by the heir presumptive. Despite his life style, Otto was more popular among the courtiers than his elder brother. Franz Ferdinand was outraged by these speculations and by the fact that he had received the modest <a href="Palais%20Modena">Modena Palace</a> as his residence and Otto the larger <a href="Palais%20Augarten">Augarten Palace</a>. Franz Ferdinand felt snubbed, although Otto assured him he had no ambitions for the throne.
Under pressure from the imperial court, he married <a href="Princess%20Maria%20Josepha%20of%20Saxony%20%281867%E2%80%931944%29">Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony</a>, daughter of King <a href="George%20of%20Saxony">George of Saxony</a> on October 2, 1886. The court in Vienna urgently needed such a wedding to repair their relationship with the <a href="House%20of%20Wettin">Saxon royal family</a>, after both Crown Prince <a href="Archduke%20Rudolf%20of%20Austria">Rudolf</a> and Otto's brother <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Franz Ferdinand</a> had snubbed the Saxons by rejecting Maria's elder sister <a href="Princess%20Mathilde%20of%20Saxony%20%281863%E2%80%931933%29">Mathilde</a>.
Otto and Maria had two sons: 
Their marriage was unhappy, however, since the Archduke was often unfaithful. He had two children by one Marie Schleinzer:
The <a href="Alpine%20club%20hut">mountain lodge</a> on the <a href="Rax">Rax</a> plateau in <a href="Lower%20Austria">Lower Austria</a>, is named after him.

Controlled Cryptographic Item

A Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI) is a <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> term for secure telecommunications or information handling equipment, associated <a href="cryptography">cryptographic</a> component or other hardware item which performs a critical <a href="communications%20security">communications security</a> (COMSEC) function. Items so designated may be unclassified but are subject to special accounting controls and required markings.
Part of the physical security protection given to COMSEC equipment and material is afforded by its special handling and accounting. CCI equipment must be controlled in a manner that affords protection at least equal to that normally provided other high value equipment, such as money, computers, and <a href="Privacy%20Act%20of%201974">Privacy Act</a>-controlled. There are two separate channels used for the handling of such equipment and materials: "the COMSEC channel" and "the administrative channel." The COMSEC channel, called the COMSEC Material Control System, is used to distribute accountable COMSEC items such as <a href="Classified%20information">classified</a> and CCI equipment, <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">keying material</a>, and maintenance manuals. Some military departments have been authorized to distribute CCI equipment through their standard <a href="logistics">logistics</a> system.
The COMSEC channel is composed of a series of COMSEC accounts, each of which has an appointed <a href="COMSEC%20Custodian">COMSEC Custodian</a> who is personally responsible and accountable for all COMSEC materials charged to his/her account. The COMSEC Custodian assumes accountability for the equipment or material upon receipt, then controls its dissemination to authorized individuals on job requirements and a need-to-know basis. The administrative channel is used to distribute COMSEC information other than that which is accountable in the COMSEC Material Control System.
Persons with access to COMSEC materials are asked, among other restrictions, to avoid unapproved travel to any countries which are adversaries of the United States, or their establishments or facilities within the U.S.

In 1828 he was elected fellow of <a href="Oriel%20College%2C%20Oxford">Oriel</a>; and after a few years there as a tutor, during which he was ordained and acted as curate at <a href="Cuddesdon">Cuddesdon</a>, he became rector of <a href="Broadwindsor">Broadwindsor</a>, Dorset (1838). He became a <a href="prebendary">prebendary</a> of <a href="Salisbury%2C%20United%20Kingdom">Sarum</a> in 1841 and of <a href="Wells%20Cathedral">Wells</a> in 1849. In 1851 he was preferred to the valuable living of <a href="East%20Brent">East Brent</a>, Somerset, and in the same year was made <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Taunton">Archdeacon of Taunton</a>.
For many years Archdeacon Denison represented the extreme <a href="High%20Tory">High Tory</a> party not only in politics but in the Church, regarding all progressive movements in education or theology as abomination, and vehemently repudiating the <a href="higher%20criticism">higher criticism</a> from the days of "<a href="Essays%20and%20Reviews">Essays and Reviews</a>" (1860) to those of "<a href="Lux%20Mundi">Lux Mundi</a>" (1890).

<doc id="1639467" title="Demosthenian Literary Society" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639467">
Demosthenian Literary Society

The Demosthenian Literary Society is a debating society at <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">The University of Georgia</a> in <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. It was founded in February 1803 by the first graduating class of the University's Franklin College. It is named after the Greek orator <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>.
The Society meets weekly Thursday nights at 7:00 during the Fall and Spring semesters at Demosthenian Hall on the historic North Campus of <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">The University of Georgia</a>.
<a href="Augustin%20Clayton">Augustin Clayton</a>, <a href="James%20Jackson%20%28congressman%29">James Jackson</a>, and Williams Rutherford are recognized as the founding fathers of Demosthenian. Clayton became the first student to receive his diploma from Franklin College and went on to become a judge of wide respect and a U.S. Representative from Georgia, with Georgia's <a href="Clayton%20County%2C%20Georgia">Clayton County</a> being named in his honor. Rutherford and Jackson went on to become professors at Franklin College.
After 167 years of male-only membership, the first female members of the Society were inducted on March 4, 1970. President Sherrill Watkins presided over the initiation of Kathy Conrad, a freshman from Atlanta, and Bebe Herring, a junior from Athens. By the late 1970s, female members were heavily active in the Society and held numerous offices—even President. In 2008, the Society put forward its first all female Inter-Society Debate team. The four women swept the debate on warrantless wiretapping and FISA reform, winning the votes of all three judges and the alternate. Today, the Society has slightly more female than male members.
Citing issues of student disenfranchisement within the UGA and U.S. political systems, the Society voted in 2012 to secede from the United States of America as the <a href="micronation">micronation</a> "Demosthenia." This resolution was acknowledged as a move to raise the Society's profile and to encourage lively debate.
Demosthenian Hall was constructed by Dr. James Tinsley of Columbia County in 1824 at a cost to the Society of $4,000. It is the fourth oldest building at the University of Georgia and was placed on the National Register for Historic Places in 1971. It has become the physical expression of a living tradition which binds generations of students. The Society’s minutes show that by September 5, 1829, the building’s $4,000 construction cost had been completely paid off. The construction was financed by the Society’s members, alumni, and friends.
Located on the University of Georgia’s historic north quadrangle, its facade in the formal Federal style forms a pleasing contrast to the later columned Greek revival structures which surround it. The front is graced with a Palladian window over a light doorway. The exterior walls are two feet thick and are of stucco over brick construction.
In 1997, Demosthenian Hall received a $200,000 facelift. Financed primarily by alumni donations and conducted by the architectural firm Serber and Barber, the construction work restored the ceiling medallion and the rest of the Upper Chamber to its original 1824 layout and color scheme. The original hard wood floors were uncovered and restored in the Lower Chamber.
The Upper Chamber is the meeting room of the Society. The speaker’s lectern has been dated to the 1820s and may have been built for the Hall. The simplicity of the carved mantels, window moldings, doors and deep paneled wainscoting emphasizes the drama of the ornate plasterwork ceiling medallion which is based on a template designed by Asher Benjamin. It is a medallion of holly leaves surrounded by swags of smaller leaves which are framed by delicate filigree. This ceiling is one of the most architecturally significant structures at the University of Georgia and is one of the few remaining examples of this form of decorative artwork.
The Lower Chamber is the social space of the Society; members can often be found studying or enjoying a game of chess in between classes. It is divided into one main room flanked on the right by two smaller rooms - designated the President's Office and the Library. Containing mostly donated furniture constructed in the late 18th and early 19th century, the Society has endeavored to maintain the historic feel of the rooms. The rooms feature high wainscoting, four fireplaces, and plaster walls.
The Society has maintained an extensive library since its founding and currently owns over 1000 volumes. Its collection surpassed that of the University's main library for the majority of the 19th century. Upon the reopening of the University after the Civil War, the Society donated its books to the University to replace the library collection that had been burned. Demosthenian maintains extensive archives of past meeting minutes, Society business, and members. Bound editions of minutes are kept in the Demosthenian Hall Library and in the Georgia Reading Room located in the University's Main Library. In addition, the most recent minutes and some historical minutes from 1829 are available online. Many books currently in the Demosthenian Library contain personal inscriptions from members and alumni who donated them.
Over the past 200 plus years, the society has enjoyed a diverse group of students who have been proud to call themselves Demosthenians. In recent years, students from a wide array of majors spanning North and South Campus have come to the society to take part in the debate and intellectual discourse that the society is known for.
Members of the society are often heavily involved on campus, having a hand in over 60 campus organizations. These groups include but are not limited to every political affiliated organization on campus, <a href="The%20Red%20and%20Black">The Red and Black</a>, numerous service and honor societies, <a href="WUOG">WUOG</a>, <a href="CURO">CURO</a>, Greek Fraternities and Sororities, fencing and are also affiliated with every major religious (UGA Atheists, Club Baptist Student Union, Pagan Student Association, Catholic Student Union) and ethnic group on campus.
In addition, the Society maintains relationships with other Literary and Debate societies across the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, including the <a href="Philodemic%20Society">Philodemic Society</a> at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> and the <a href="Dialectic%20and%20Philanthropic%20Societies">Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies</a> at <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">UNC-Chapel Hill</a>.
All meetings of the Demosthenian Literary Society are run in accordance with Parliamentary Procedure as set out in <a href="Robert%27s%20Rules%20of%20Order">Robert's Rules of Order</a>.
The Demosthenian Literary Society was founded for the specific purpose of promoting the art of extemporizing, or extemporaneous speaking. In this style, only the presenters know what topics are to be debated at the meeting, and all subsequent speeches are performed based on prior knowledge and without extensive preparation, though notes can be taken during other speeches. During their speeches, the speakers are also potentially subject to questions, preferably of a non-rambling nature. Speeches are generally limited to five minutes, and hand signals are provided to the speaker when he/she has three minutes, two minutes, one minute, thirty seconds, and fifteen seconds left.
Elections of the Demosthenian Literary Society take place during the penultimate meeting of each semester. Officer nominations take place during the two meetings immediately prior to elections. While guests may remain in the upper chamber for candidates' speeches, member debate and voting of officer candidates is confidential. For this reason, election day is the only meeting of the semester that guests are discouraged from attending.
Members of the Demosthenian Literary Society are awarded Speaker's Points for outstanding service to the society and participation in related activities. Services and activities worthy of Speaker's Points include: presenting resolutions before the Society, taking part in special programs, and serving as an officer or on a committee. Points are awarded by the President, the Judicial Council, and Committee heads. Accumulation of points is necessary to hold certain officer positions in the society and to obtain a Speaker's Key.
Members of the Society, upon receiving enough speakers points or being in the society for a certain amount of time, are eligible to run for officer positions. The Society has 13 officers. They are President, Vice President, Secretary, Chief Justice, two Associate Justices, Treasurer, Hall Administrator, Hall Preservationist, Historian, Sergeant-at-Arms, Librarian and Custodian. The offices of Treasurer, Hall Administrator, Hall Preservationist, and Historian are all yearlong positions elected every Spring while the others are elected each semester.
The Society has a faculty adviser who serves as a liaison between the University of Georgia and the Society. Notable faculty advisers who contributed greatly to Demosthenian include Albert B Saye and Cal Logue. The current adviser is <a href="John%20Knox%20%28meteorologist%29">John Knox</a>, meteorologist and Associate Professor of Geography. Preceding Dr. Knox, Dr. John Murphy and Dr. Daniel Kapust served as the Society's adviser until 2008 and 2011 respectively.
The Society has committees dedicated to Public Relations, Programs, Alumni Relations, Digital Media, Finance and Hall Preservation. The Alumni Relations committee is responsible for the yearly All Night Meeting and is thus a year-long committee, while the other committees are appointed each semester. The Programs committee organizes speakers, resolutions, critics, and Robert's Rules workshops and several social events throughout each semester. The only requirement of serving on a committee is membership in the society. The Vice President serves over all the committees and appoints the Chair of each committee at the beginning of every semester unless otherwise specified in the Demosthenian constitution.
As one of the oldest student organizations in the nation, the Society has established a number of traditions and annual events throughout the course of its 200+ year history.
For service to the Society, members are awarded speaker's points. After accumulating 32 such points, members have the honor of being awarded a Speaker's Key. The Speaker's Key is a gold lapel pin that shows a member's devotion to the society. After a decade long hiatus, speaker's keys returned to the Society in late 2007. The new Speaker's Keys were first awarded at the annual All Night Meeting on February 16, 2008.
On the Saturday that falls closest to February 19, the anniversary of its founding, the Demosthenian Literary Society hosts the All Night Meeting. The All Night Meeting lasts for twelve hours, beginning at 7 pm on Saturday and ending at 7 am on Sunday. Dinner is served at 6 pm and the meeting opens with guest keynote speakers. The meeting then continues with debate among current members, guests, and alumni of the Society throughout the night and into the morning. Those members who are present until the end of the meeting are awarded a Speaker's Point.
An annual tradition dating to the fall of 1995, members and guests are called up one by one to pull a random resolution out of a hat and then immediately give a presenting speech in the affirmative. Participants are given five minutes to make a case for the resolution and must present the resolution they pull from the hat. These resolutions are often of a humorous nature, but may cover any and all topics.
Because the Society traditionally participates in impromptu debate, once a year a meeting is dedicated to original orations and famous or not-so-famous declamations. The meeting takes place in two parts: Orations and Declamations. The events are considered a competition with the winner of each event winning a speaker's point. The competition is judged by the members of the Judicial Council. The competition normally takes place in early April.
Each spring the Demosthenian Literary Society holds a debate with their <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Literary%20Society">rival literary society</a> at the University of Georgia. Generally, the debate is held in the Hatton-Lovejoy courtroom at the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia%20School%20of%20Law">Law School</a> on North Campus. The judges are usually professors from the University of Georgia and are selected by having their names drawn from a hat (using a negotiated list approved by both societies).

Loose coupling

In <a href="computing">computing</a> and <a href="systems%20design">systems design</a> a loosely coupled system is one in which each of its <a href="Software%20component%23Component%20Definition">component</a>s has, or makes use of, little or no knowledge of the definitions of other separate components. Sub-areas include the <a href="Coupling%20%28computer%20programming%29">coupling</a> of classes, interfaces, data, and services.
Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one component has of another. Loose coupling in computing is interpreted as <a href="Encapsulation%20%28object-oriented%20programming%29">encapsulation</a> vs. non-encapsulation. 
An example of tight coupling occurs when a dependent class contains a pointer directly to a concrete class which provides the required behavior. The dependency cannot be substituted, or its "signature" changed, without requiring a change to the dependent class. Loose coupling occurs when the dependent class contains a pointer only to an interface, which can then be implemented by one or many concrete classes. The dependent class's dependency is to a "contract" specified by the interface; a defined list of methods and/or properties that implementing classes must provide. Any class that implements the interface can thus satisfy the dependency of a dependent class without having to change the class. This allows for extensibility in software design; a new class implementing an interface can be written to replace a current dependency in some or all situations, without requiring a change to the dependent class; the new and old classes can be interchanged freely. Strong coupling does not allow this.
This is a <a href="Unified%20Modeling%20Language">UML</a> diagram (created in <a href="Telelogic%20Rhapsody">IBM Rhapsody</a>) illustrating an example of "loose" coupling between a dependent class and a set of concrete classes, which provide the required behavior:
For comparison, this diagram illustrates the alternative design with "strong" coupling between the dependent class and a provider:
Computer programming languages having notions of either functions as the core module (see <a href="Functional%20programming">Functional programming</a>) or functions as objects provide excellent examples of loosely coupled programming. Functional languages have patterns of <a href="Continuation">Continuation</a>s, <a href="Closure%20%28computer%20programming%29">Closure</a>, or generators. See <a href="Clojure">Clojure</a> and <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> as examples of function programming languages. Object oriented languages like <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> and <a href="Ruby%20%28programming%20language%29">Ruby</a> have code blocks, while <a href="Eiffel%20%28programming%20language%29">Eiffel</a> has agents. The basic idea is to objectify (encapsulate as an object) a function independent of any other enclosing concept (e.g. decoupling an object function from any direct knowledge of the enclosing object). See <a href="First-class%20function">First-class function</a> for further insight into functions as objects, which qualifies as one form of first-class function.
So, for example, in an object oriented language, when a function of an object is referenced as an object (freeing it from having any knowledge of its enclosing host object) the new function object can be passed, stored, and called at a later time. Recipient objects (to whom these functional objects are given) can safely execute (call) the contained function at their own convenience without any direct knowledge of the enclosing host object. In this way, a program can execute chains or groups of functional objects, while safely decoupled from having any direct reference to the enclosing host object.
Phone numbers are an excellent analog and can easily illustrate the degree of this decoupling.
For example: Some entity provides another with a phone number to call to get a particular job done. When the number is called, the calling entity is effectively saying, "Please do this job for me." The decoupling or loose coupling is immediately apparent. The entity receiving the number to call may have no knowledge of where the number came from (e.g. a reference to the supplier of the number). On the other side, the caller is decoupled from specific knowledge of who they are calling, where they are, and knowing how the receiver of the call operates internally.
Carrying the example a step further, the caller might say to the receiver of the call, "Please do this job for me. Call me back at this number when you are finished." The `number' being offered to the receiver is referred to as a "Call-back". Again, the loose coupling or decoupled nature of this functional object is apparent. The receiver of the call-back is unaware of what or who is being called. It only knows that it can make the call and decides for itself when to call. In reality, the call-back may not even be to the one who provided the call-back in the first place. This level of indirection is what makes function objects an excellent technology for achieving loosely coupled programs.
The degree of the loose coupling can be measured by noting the number of changes in <a href="data%20element">data element</a>s that could occur in the sending or receiving systems and determining if the computers would still continue communicating correctly. These changes include items such as:
Loose coupling of interfaces can be enhanced by publishing data in a standard format (such as <a href="XML">XML</a> or <a href="JSON">JSON</a>). 
Loose coupling between program components can be enhanced by using standard data types in parameters. Passing customized data types or objects requires both components to have knowledge of the custom data definition.
Loose coupling of services can be enhanced by reducing the information passed into a service to the key data. For example, a service that sends a letter is most reusable when just the customer identifier is passed and the customer address is obtained within the service. This decouples services because services do not need to be called in a specific order (e.g. GetCustomerAddress, SendLetter)
Components in a loosely coupled system can be replaced with alternative implementations that provide the same services.
Components in a loosely coupled system are less constrained to the same platform, language, operating system, or build environment
If systems are de-coupled in time using <a href="Message-oriented%20middleware">Message-oriented middleware</a>, it is difficult to also provide transactional integrity. Data replication across different systems provides loose coupling (in availability), but creates issues in maintaining synchronization.
Loose coupling in broader systems design is achieved by the use of transactions, queues, standards, and ???,

List of songs about or referencing Elvis Presley

The iconic nature of <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> in music and popular culture have often made him a subject of, or a touchstone in numerous songs, both in America and throughout the world. A few of Presley's own songs became huge hits in certain regions of the world, in versions whose translation into the required language bore little, or no resemblance to the original lyrics. For instance, "Good Rocking tonight", which Elvis made famous throughout the world, became "La voix d'Elvis", a story about how his voice and music inspired a generation of French youngsters to rebel against French colonialism in Algeria. Likewise, the title song to his fourth movie, "King Creole" (a reference to the name of a nightclub, in the movie), when translated into Spanish by Los Teen Tops, became "Rey del Rock", with lyrics which, irrespective of the fact his name was not actually mentioned, went on to explain, in detail, why Presley was given the title of Rock King.

Black Guardian

The Black Guardian is a character in the long-running British <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction television series</a> "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". He was played by <a href="Valentine%20Dyall">Valentine Dyall</a>.
The Black Guardian is an <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic personification</a> of the forces of <a href="entropy">entropy</a> and chaos, the counterpart of the <a href="White%20Guardian">White Guardian</a>, a personification of order. The two Guardians balance out the forces in the universe, although the Black Guardian seems to desire to upset the balance in favour of chaos and evil while the White Guardian prefers to maintain the status quo. The Guardians both appeared in <a href="List%20of%20Doctor%20Who%20serials%23Season%2016%20%281978%E2%80%9379%29">Season 16</a> of the programme, where all six serials of that season were linked together in the quest for <a href="the%20Key%20to%20Time">the Key to Time</a>, an artifact of immense power that would give the wielder supreme power over all existence.
The White Guardian gave the <a href="Fourth%20Doctor">Fourth Doctor</a> the task of finding the scattered six segments of the Key at the beginning of "<a href="The%20Ribos%20Operation">The Ribos Operation</a>". Once <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">the Doctor</a> had assembled the Key, the Black Guardian disguised himself as the White and attempted to trick the Doctor into handing it over. The Doctor saw through the deception after the Guardian appeared indifferent to the fact that the sixth segment — Princess Astra of Atrios — had ceased her independent existence by becoming part of the Key. The Doctor then dispersed the Key, earning the Black Guardian's eternal enmity and forcing the Doctor, for a period, to attach a randomiser to his <a href="TARDIS">TARDIS</a> to avoid being tracked through time and space.
He briefly appears at the end of "<a href="Logopolis">Logopolis</a>", in the montage of past enemies taunting the Doctor. The next appearance of the Black Guardian was in the 1983 serial "<a href="Mawdryn%20Undead">Mawdryn Undead</a>", the first of three linked serials known as the Black Guardian Trilogy. He enlisted a young <a href="public%20school%20%28England%29">public school</a> student named <a href="Vislor%20Turlough">Vislor Turlough</a>, offering the young man (who was really an alien exiled on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>) passage home if he killed the Doctor (then in his <a href="Fifth%20Doctor">fifth incarnation</a>) and death if he failed. Turlough joined the TARDIS crew, struggling with the dilemma and eventually chose loyalty to the Doctor in "<a href="Enlightenment%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Enlightenment</a>", the last serial of the trilogy. Although extremely powerful, the Guardians apparently cannot be seen to act directly, which is why they can only affect things through agents such as Turlough and the Doctor. Other agents of the Black Guardian include Cessair of Diplos in "<a href="The%20Stones%20of%20Blood">The Stones of Blood</a>", The Shadow in "<a href="The%20Armageddon%20Factor">The Armageddon Factor</a>" and Captain Wrack in "<a href="Enlightenment%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Enlightenment</a>".
Turlough's choice and the use of the Enlightenment crystal apparently banished the Black Guardian – he is seen to burst into flames and appear in negative again, before disappearing. The White Guardian warned, though, that he would return – angrier now that the Doctor had thwarted him twice. However, the character has yet to make a return appearance in the television series.
The Black Guardian features in the <a href="Virgin%20Missing%20Adventures">Virgin Missing Adventures</a> <a href="Doctor%20Who%20spin-offs">spin-off</a> novel "<a href="The%20Well-Mannered%20War">The Well-Mannered War</a>", by <a href="Gareth%20Roberts%20%28writer%29">Gareth Roberts</a>. In that story, the Black Guardian catches up with the Fourth Doctor and Romana following the loss of the Randomiser, trapping them in a situation where they must either remain in the TARDIS and the Time Vortex for all eternity or release a powerful telepathic insect hive on 26th-century Earth, and they are forced to leave the known universe as a consequence. It is of course possible that the Doctor was later able to return to our universe.
The Black Guardian resurfaced again in <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a>'s short story "Time and Time Again", published in an issue of "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>" commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Doctor Who television programme. In the story, the Black Guardian punishes the Doctor's defiance by altering history so that the Doctor never left Gallifrey. In the revised timeline, the Doctor never visited Earth, and the planet's vulnerability has resulted in repeated alien invasions. The White Guardian commissions the Doctor, Benny, and Ace to journey across the Doctor's own timestream to once again assemble the <a href="Key%20to%20Time">Key to Time</a>, the fragments of which are disguised as artifacts from the Doctor's past in the possession of each of his past incarnations.
In the <a href="BBC%20Books">BBC Books</a> spin-off novel "<a href="The%20Quantum%20Archangel">The Quantum Archangel</a>" by <a href="Craig%20Hinton">Craig Hinton</a>, the Black Guardian appears briefly with the White Guardian and four others, who form a Council of Guardians that oversee reality. The other four Guardians were first mentioned in "<a href="Divided%20Loyalties%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Divided Loyalties</a>" by Gary Russell, which states that one of them is the <a href="Celestial%20Toymaker">Celestial Toymaker</a>.
The Black Guardian returns in the final moments of the <a href="Big%20Finish%20Productions">Big Finish</a> <a href="radio%20drama">audio drama</a> "<a href="The%20Judgement%20of%20Isskar">The Judgement of Isskar</a>", and reappears in the proceeding two stories - "<a href="The%20Destroyer%20of%20Delights">The Destroyer of Delights</a>" and "<a href="The%20Chaos%20Pool">The Chaos Pool</a>". Once again, The Key to Time is being sought, but this time with the <a href="Fifth%20Doctor">Fifth Doctor</a>. In these plays, The Black Guardian is played by <a href="David%20Troughton">David Troughton</a>. He is portrayed as losing his powers due to the Key decaying, forcing him and the White Guardian to operate on a lower level of existence.

Route 107 begins in the village of <a href="Pascoag%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Pascoag</a> as Pascoag Main Street heading northeast. It soon reaches the village of <a href="Harrisville%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Harrisville</a>, entering along Chapel Street. Route 107 intersects <a href="Route%2098%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">Route 98</a> in the center of the village then leaves east along East Avenue. Route 107 soon intersects <a href="Route%20102%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">Route 102</a> (Bronco Highway) and continues for another block to end at Victory Highway, which is an old alignment of Route 102 that is still state-maintained.
Before 1934, Route 107 was on the opposite side of the State. Originally, Route 107 started at the junction of present-day <a href="Route%203%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">Route 3</a> and <a href="Route%20138%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">Route 138</a> in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Richmond</a>.

Const (computer programming)

In the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>, and <a href="D%20%28programming%20language%29">D</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s, const is a <a href="type%20qualifier">type qualifier</a>: a <a href="Keyword%20%28computer%20programming%29">keyword</a> applied to a <a href="data%20type">data type</a> that indicates that the data is constant (does not vary). While this can be used to declare <a href="Constant%20%28computer%20programming%29">constants</a>, codice_1 in the C family of languages differs from similar constructs in other languages in being part of the "type," and thus has complicated behavior when combined with pointers, references, <a href="composite%20data%20type">composite data type</a>s, and type-checking.
When applied in an <a href="object%20%28computer%20science%29">object</a> <a href="Declaration%20%28computer%20programming%29">declaration</a>, it indicates that the object is a <a href="Constant%20%28computer%20programming%29">constant</a>: its <a href="Value%20%28computer%20science%29">value</a> does not change, unlike a <a href="variable%20%28computer%20science%29">variable</a>. This basic use – to declare constants – has parallels in many other languages.
However, unlike in other languages, in the C family of languages the codice_1 is part of the "type," not part of the "object." For example, in C, codice_3 declares an object codice_4 of codice_5 type – the codice_1 is part of the type, as if it were parsed “(const int) x” – while in <a href="Ada%20%28programming%20language%29">Ada</a>, codice_7 declares a constant (a kind of object) codice_8 of codice_9 type: the codice_10 is part of the "object," but not part of the "type."
This has two subtle results. Firstly, codice_1 can be applied to parts of a more complex type – for example, codice_12 declares a constant pointer to a constant integer, while codice_13 declares a variable pointer to a constant integer, and codice_14 declares a constant pointer to a variable integer. Secondly, because codice_1 is part of the type, it must match as part of type-checking. For example, the following code is invalid:
void f(int&amp; x);
const int i;
f(i);
because the argument to codice_16 must be a "variable" integer, but codice_17 is a "constant" integer. This matching is a form of <a href="program%20correctness">program correctness</a>, and is known as const-correctness. This allows a form of <a href="programming%20by%20contract">programming by contract</a>, where functions specify as part of their <a href="type%20signature">type signature</a> whether they modify their arguments or not, and whether their <a href="return%20value">return value</a> is modifiable or not. This type-checking is primarily of interest in pointers and references – not basic value types like integers – but also for <a href="composite%20data%20type">composite data type</a>s or templated types such as <a href="Container%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">containers</a>. It is concealed by the fact that the codice_1 can often be omitted, due to <a href="type%20coercion">type coercion</a> (implicit <a href="type%20conversion">type conversion</a>) and C being <a href="call-by-value">call-by-value</a> (C++ and D are either call-by-value or call-by-reference).
The idea of const-ness does not imply that the variable as it is stored in the <a href="computer">computer</a>'s <a href="computer%20storage">memory</a> is unwritable. Rather, codice_1-ness is a <a href="compile-time">compile-time</a> construct that indicates what a programmer "should" do, not necessarily what they "can" do. Note, however, that in the case of predefined data (such as codice_20 <a href="string%20literal">string literal</a>s), C codice_1 is "often" unwritable.
In addition, a (non-static) member-function can be declared as codice_1. In this case, the <a href="this%20%28computer%20programming%29">codice_23 pointer</a> inside such a function is of type codice_24 rather than merely of type codice_25. This means that non-const functions for this object cannot be called from inside such a function, nor can <a href="field%20%28computer%20science%29">member variables</a> be modified. In C++, a member variable can be declared as codice_26, indicating that this restriction does not apply to it. In some cases, this can be useful, for example with <a href="cache%20%28computing%29">caching</a>, <a href="reference%20counting">reference counting</a>, and <a href="data%20synchronization">data synchronization</a>. In these cases, the logical meaning (state) of the object is unchanged, but the object is not physically constant since its bitwise representation may change.
In C, C++, and D, all data types, including those defined by the user, can be declared codice_1, and const-correctness dictates that all variables or objects should be declared as such unless they need to be modified. Such proactive use of codice_1 makes values "easier to understand, track, and reason about," and it thus increases the readability and comprehensibility of code and makes working in teams and maintaining code simpler because it communicates information about a value's intended use. This can help the <a href="compiler">compiler</a> as well as the developer when reasoning about code. It can also enable an <a href="optimizing%20compiler">optimizing compiler</a> to generate more efficient code.
For simple non-pointer data types, applying the codice_1 qualifier is straightforward. It can go on either side of the type for historical reasons (that is, codice_30 is equivalent to codice_31). On some implementations, using codice_1 on both sides of the type (for instance, codice_33) generates a warning but not an error.
For pointer and reference types, the meaning of codice_1 is more complicated – either the pointer itself, or the value being pointed to, or both, can be codice_1. Further, the syntax can be confusing. A pointer can be declared as a codice_1 pointer to writable value, or a writable pointer to a codice_1 value, or codice_1 pointer to codice_1 value. A codice_1 pointer cannot be reassigned to point to a different object from the one it is initially assigned, but it can be used to modify the value that it points to (called the "pointee"). Reference variables are thus an alternate syntax for codice_1 pointers. A pointer to a codice_1 object, on the other hand, can be reassigned to point to another memory location (which should be an object of the same type or of a convertible type), but it cannot be used to modify the memory that it is pointing to. A codice_1 pointer to a codice_1 object can also be declared and can neither be used to modify the pointee nor be reassigned to point to another object. The following code illustrates these subtleties:
void Foo( int * ptr,
Following usual C convention for declarations, declaration follows use, and the codice_45 in a pointer is written on the pointer, indicating dereferencing. For example, in the declaration codice_46, the dereferenced form codice_47 is an codice_48, while the reference form codice_49 is a pointer to an codice_48. Thus codice_1 modifies the "name" to its right. The C++ convention is instead to associate the codice_45 with the type, as in codice_53 and read the codice_1 as modifying the "type" to the left. codice_55 can thus be read as "codice_56 is a codice_57" (the value is constant), or "codice_58 is a codice_59" (the pointer is a pointer to a constant integer). Thus:
int *ptr; // *ptr is an int value
int const *ptrToConst; // *ptrToConst is a constant (int: integer value)
int * const constPtr; // constPtr is a constant (int *: integer pointer)
int const * const constPtrToConst; // constPtrToConst is a constant (pointer)
Following C++ convention of analyzing the type, not the value, a <a href="rule%20of%20thumb">rule of thumb</a> is to read the declaration from right to left. Thus, everything to the left of the star can be identified as the pointee type and everything to the right of the star are the pointer properties. For instance, in our example above, codice_59 can be read as a writable pointer that refers to a non-writable integer, and codice_61 can be read as a non-writable pointer that refers to a writable integer.
C/C++ also allows the codice_1 to be placed to the left of the type, in the following syntax:
const int* ptrToConst; //identical to: int const * ptrToConst,
const int* const constPtrToConst;//identical to: int const * const constPtrToConst
This more clearly separates the two locations for the codice_1, and allows the codice_45 to always be bound to its preceding type, though it still requires reading right-to-left, as follows:
int* ptr;
const int* ptrToConst; // (const int)*, not const (int*)
int* const constPtr;
const int* const constPtrToConst;
Note, however, that despite the different convention for formatting C++ code, the semantics of pointer declaration are the same:
int* a; // a is an int pointer
int* a, b; // TRICKY: a is an int pointer as above, but b is not; b is an int value
int* a, *b; // both a and b are pointers; *a and *b are int values
Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ recommends only declaring one variable per line if using the C++ convention, to avoid this issue.
C++ references follow similar rules. A declaration of a codice_1 reference is redundant since references can never be made to refer to another object:
int i = 22;
int const &amp; refToConst = i; // OK
int &amp; const constRef = i; // Error the "const" is redundant
Even more complicated declarations can result when using multidimensional arrays and references (or pointers) to pointers; however, some have argued that these are confusing and error-prone and that they therefore should generally be avoided or replaced with higher-level structures.
codice_1 can be declared both on function parameters and on variables (<a href="static%20variable">static</a> or automatic, including global or local). The interpretation varies between uses. A codice_1 static variable (global variable or static local variable) is a constant, and may be used for data like mathematical constants, such as codice_68 – realistically longer, or overall compile-time parameters. A codice_1 automatic variable (non-static local variable) means that <a href="single%20assignment">single assignment</a> is happening, though a different value may be used each time, such as codice_70 A codice_1 parameter in pass-by-reference means that the referenced value is not modified – it is part of the <a href="Design%20by%20contract">contract</a> – while a codice_1 parameter in pass-by-value (or the pointer itself, in pass-by-reference) does not add anything to the interface (as the value has been copied), but indicates that internally, the function does not modify the parameter (it is a single assignment). For this reason, some favor using codice_1 in parameters only for pass-by-reference, where it changes the contract, but not for pass-by-value, where it exposes the implementation.
In order to take advantage of the <a href="design%20by%20contract">design by contract</a> approach for user-defined types (structs and classes), which can have methods as well as member data, the programmer must tag instance methods as codice_1 if they don't modify the object's data members.
Applying the codice_1 qualifier to instance methods thus is an essential feature for const-correctness, and is not available in many other <a href="object-oriented">object-oriented</a> languages such as <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> and <a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a> or in <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="C%2B%2B/CLI">C++/CLI</a> or <a href="Managed%20Extensions%20for%20C%2B%2B">Managed Extensions for C++</a>.
While codice_1 methods can be called by codice_1 and non-codice_1 objects alike, non-codice_1 methods can only be invoked by non-codice_1 objects.
The const modifier on an instance method applies to the object pointed to by the "codice_81" pointer, which is an implicit argument passed to all instance methods.
Thus having const methods is a way to apply const-correctness to the implicit "codice_23" pointer argument just like other arguments.
This example illustrates:
class C
public:
void Foo(C&amp; nonConstC, const C&amp; constC)
In the above code, the implicit "codice_23" pointer to codice_84 has the type "codice_85"; whereas the "codice_23" pointer to codice_87 has type "codice_88", indicating that the method cannot modify its object through the "codice_23" pointer.
Often the programmer will supply both a codice_1 and a non-codice_1 method with the same name (but possibly quite different uses) in a class to accommodate both types of callers. Consider:
class MyArray
public:
void Foo( MyArray &amp; array, MyArray const &amp; constArray )
The codice_1-ness of the calling object determines which version of codice_93 will be invoked and thus whether or not the caller is given a reference with which he can manipulate or only observe the private data in the object.
The two methods technically have different signatures because their "codice_23" pointers have different types, allowing the compiler to choose the right one. (Returning a codice_1 reference to an codice_48, instead of merely returning the codice_48 by value, may be overkill in the second method, but the same technique can be used for arbitrary types, as in the <a href="Standard%20Template%20Library">Standard Template Library</a>.)
There are several loopholes to pure const-correctness in C and C++. They exist primarily for compatibility with existing code.
The first, which applies only to C++, is the use of codice_98, which allows the programmer to strip the codice_1 qualifier, making any object modifiable.
The necessity of stripping the qualifier arises when using existing code and libraries that cannot be modified but which are not const-correct. For instance, consider this code:
// Prototype for a function which we cannot change but which
// we know does not modify the pointee passed in.
void LibraryFunc(int* ptr, int size);
void CallLibraryFunc(const int* ptr, int size)
However, any attempt to modify an object that is itself declared codice_1 by means of codice_101 results in undefined behavior according to the ISO C++ Standard.
In the example above, if codice_49 references a global, local, or member variable declared as codice_1, or an object allocated on the heap via codice_104, the code is only correct if codice_105 really does not modify the value pointed to by codice_49.
The C language has a need of a loophole because a certain situation exists. Variables with static storage duration are allowed to be defined with an initial value. However, the initializer can use only constants like string constants and other literals, and is not allowed to use non-constant elements like variable names, whether the initializer elements are declared codice_1 or not, or whether the static duration variable is being declared codice_1 or not. There is a non-portable way to initialize a codice_1 variable that has static storage duration. By carefully constructing a typecast on the left hand side of a later assignment, a codice_1 variable can be written to, effectively stripping away the codice_1 attribute and 'initializing' it with non-constant elements like other codice_1 variables and such. Writing into a codice_1 variable this way may work as intended, but it causes undefined behavior and seriously contradicts const-correctness:
const size_t bufferSize = 8*1024;
const size_t userTextBufferSize; //initial value depends on const bufferSize, can't be initialized here
int setupUserTextBox(textBox_t *defaultTextBoxType, rect_t *defaultTextBoxLocation)
Another loophole applies both to C and C++. Specifically, the languages dictate that member pointers and references are "shallow" with respect to the codice_1-ness of their owners — that is, a containing object that is codice_1 has all codice_1 members except that member pointees (and referees) are still mutable. To illustrate, consider this C++ code:
struct S
void Foo(const S &amp; s)
Although the object codice_117 passed to codice_118 is constant, which makes all of its members constant, the pointee accessible through codice_119 is still modifiable, though this may not be desirable from the standpoint of codice_1-correctness because codice_117 might solely own the pointee.
For this reason, Meyers argues that the default for member pointers and references should be "deep" codice_1-ness, which could be overridden by a codice_123 qualifier when the pointee is not owned by the container, but this strategy would create compatibility issues with existing code.
Thus, for historical reasons, this loophole remains open in C and C++.
The latter loophole can be closed by using a class to hide the pointer behind a codice_1-correct interface, but such classes either don't support the usual copy semantics from a codice_1 object (implying that the containing class cannot be copied by the usual semantics either) or allow other loopholes by permitting the stripping of codice_1-ness through inadvertent or intentional copying.
Finally, several functions in the <a href="C%20standard%20library">C standard library</a> violate const-correctness, as they accept a codice_1 pointer to a character string and return a non-codice_1 pointer to a part of the same string. codice_129 and codice_130 are among these functions.
Some implementations of the C++ standard library, such as Microsoft's try to close this loophole by providing two <a href="function%20overloading">overloaded</a> versions of some functions: a "codice_1" version and a "non-codice_1" version.
The use of the type system to express constancy leads to various complexities and problems, and has accordingly been criticized and not adopted outside the narrow C family of C, C++, and D. Java and C#, which are heavily influenced by C and C++, both explicitly rejected codice_1-style type qualifiers, instead expressing constancy by keywords that apply to the identifier (codice_134 in Java, codice_1 and codice_136 in C#). Even within C and C++, the use of codice_1 varies significantly, with some projects and organizations using it consistently, and others avoiding it.
The codice_1 type qualifier causes difficulties when the logic of a function is agnostic to whether its input is constant or not, but returns a value which should be of the same qualified type as an input. In other words, for these functions, if the input is constant (const-qualified), the return value should be as well, but if the input is variable (not const-qualified), the return value should be as well. Because the <a href="type%20signature">type signature</a> of these functions differs, it requires two functions (or potentially more, in case of multiple inputs) with the same logic – a form of <a href="generic%20programming">generic programming</a>.
This problem arises even for simple functions in the C standard library, notably codice_138; this observation is credited by Ritchie to Tom Plum in the mid 1980s. The codice_138 function locates a character in a string; formally, it returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character codice_142 in the string codice_117, and in classic C (K&amp;R C) its prototype is:
char *strchr(char *s, int c);
The codice_138 function does not modify the input string, but the return value is often used by the caller to modify the string, such as:
if (p = strchr(q, '/'))
Thus on the one hand the input string "can" be const (since it is not modified by the function), and if the input string is const the return value should be as well – most simply because it might return exactly the input pointer, if the first character is a match – but on the other hand the return value should not be const if the original string was not const, since the caller may wish to use the pointer to modify the original string.
In C++ this is done via <a href="function%20overloading">function overloading</a>, typically implemented via a <a href="Template%20%28C%2B%2B%29">template</a>, resulting in two functions, so that the return value has the same const-qualified type as the input:
char* strchr(char* s, int c);
const char* strchr(const char* s, int c);
These can in turn be defined by a template:
template <t>
In D this is handled via the codice_145 keyword, which acts as a wildcard for const, immutable, or unqualified (variable), yielding:
inout(char)* strchr(inout(char)* s, int c);
However, in C neither of these is possible, since C does not have function overloading, and instead this is handled by having a single function where the input is constant but the output is writable:
char *strchr(const char *s, int c);
This allows idiomatic C code, but does strip the const qualifier if the input actually was const-qualified, violating type safety. This solution was proposed by Ritchie, and subsequently adopted. This difference is one of the failures of <a href="compatibility%20of%20C%20and%20C%2B%2B">compatibility of C and C++</a>.
In Version 2 of the <a href="D%20%28programming%20language%29">D programming language</a>, two keywords relating to const exist. The codice_146 keyword denotes data that cannot be modified through any reference.
The codice_1 keyword denotes a non-mutable view of mutable data.
Unlike C++ codice_1, D codice_1 and codice_146 are "deep" or <a href="transitive%20relation">transitive</a>, and anything reachable through a codice_1 or codice_146 object is codice_1 or codice_146 respectively.
Example of const vs. immutable in D
int[] foo = new int[5]; // foo is mutable.
const int[] bar = foo; // bar is a const view of mutable data.
immutable int[] baz = foo; // Error: all views of immutable data must be immutable.
immutable int[] nums = new immutable(int)[5]; // No mutable reference to nums may be created.
const int[] constNums = nums; // Works. immutable is implicitly convertible to const.
int[] mutableNums = nums; // Error: Cannot create a mutable view of immutable data.
Example of transitive or deep const in D
class Foo {
immutable Foo foo = new immutable(Foo);
foo.next.num = 5; // Won't compile. foo.next is of type immutable(Foo).
codice_1 was introduced by <a href="Bjarne%20Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> in <a href="C%20with%20Classes">C with Classes</a>, the predecessor to <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>, in 1981, and was originally called codice_136. As to motivation, Stroustrup writes:
The first use, as a scoped and typed alternative to macros, was analogously fulfilled for function-like macros via the codice_157 keyword. Constant pointers, and the codice_158 notation, were suggested by Dennis Ritchie and so adopted.
codice_1 was then adopted in C as part of standardization, and appears in <a href="ANSI%20C">C89</a> (and subsequent versions) along with the other type qualifier, codice_160. A further qualifier, codice_161, was suggested at the December 1987 meeting of the X3J11 committee, but was rejected; its goal was ultimately fulfilled by the codice_162 keyword in <a href="C99">C99</a>. Ritchie was not very supportive of these additions, arguing that they did not "carry their weight", but ultimately did not argue for their removal from the standard.
D subsequently inherited codice_1 from C++, where it is known as a "type constructor" (not <a href="type%20qualifier">type qualifier</a>) and added two further type constructors, codice_146 and codice_145, to handle related use cases.
Other languages do not follow C/C++ in having constancy part of the type, though they often have superficially similar constructs and may use the codice_1 keyword. Typically this is only used for constants (constant objects).
C# has a codice_1 keyword, but with radically different and simpler semantics: it means a compile-time constant, and is not part of the type.
<a href="Nim%20%28programming%20language%29">Nim</a> has a codice_1 keyword similar to that of C#: it also declares a compile-time constant rather than forming part of the type. However, in Nim, a constant can be declared from any expression that can be evaluated at compile time. In C#, only C# built-in types can be declared as codice_1; user-defined types, including classes, structs, and arrays, cannot be codice_1.
Java does not have codice_1 – it instead has codice_134, which can be applied to local "variable" declarations and applies to the "identifier," not the type. It has a different object-oriented use for object members, which is the origin of the name.
Interestingly, the Java language specification regards codice_1 as a reserved keyword – i.e., one that cannot be used as variable identifier – but assigns no semantics to it: it is a "reserved word" (it cannot be used in identifiers) but not a "keyword" (it has no special meaning). It is thought that the reservation of the keyword occurred to allow for an extension of the Java language to include C++-style codice_1 methods and pointer to codice_1 type. An enhancement request ticket for implementing codice_1 correctness exists in the <a href="Java%20Community%20Process">Java Community Process</a>, but was closed in 2005 on the basis that it was impossible to implement in a backwards-compatible fashion.
The contemporary <a href="Ada%2083">Ada 83</a> independently had the notion of a constant object and a codice_10 keyword, with <a href="input%20parameter">input parameter</a>s and loop parameters being implicitly constant. Here the codice_10 is a property of the object, not of the type.

Marquise de Créquy

Renée-Caroline-"Victoire" de Froulay de Tessé, marquise de Créquy de Heymont de Canaples d'Ambrières (1704–1803), was a French woman of letters, by marriage a member of the <a href="Cr%C3%A9quy%20family">Créquy family</a>, which counted several distinguished public servants and prelates, particularly in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The "Souvenirs de la Marquise de Créquy" is attributed to her by university librarians.
In her "Souvenirs", which consists mainly of accurate noble genealogies and court gossip from the reigns of <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>, <a href="Louis%20XV">Louis XV</a>, <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> and <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, there is a tale for which the author of the "Souvenirs" is the sole authority. This story, widely believed in France, is her statement, with a detailed story to back it up, that Britain's national anthem, "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>", was in fact written by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a> and sung by a French girls' school to greet Louis XIV. The French author of "Souvenirs" further states that the tune was later plagiarized by <a href="Handel">Handel</a> and sold to the British crown as their <a href="Royal%20anthem">anthem</a>.
If it is true, as some have claimed, that the story about the sale of the anthem is actually from a much later tabloid, then this anachronism is a reason why the author of "Souvenirs" is sometimes placed in the company of forgers, alongside the authors of such works as the "<a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a>", "<a href="De%20Situ%20Britanniae">De Situ Britanniae</a>", and <a href="Annio%20of%20Viterbo">Annio of Viterbo</a>. If, on the other hand, the French tabloids of the 1850s published Madame de Créquy's story based on her memoirs, it's possible she believed the story to be true, or that the story is true.

Illuyanka

In <a href="Hittite%20mythology">Hittite mythology</a>, Illuyanka was a <a href="serpent%20%28symbolism%29">serpentine</a> <a href="dragon">dragon</a> slain by <a href="Tarhunt">Tarhunt</a> (), the <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> incarnation of the <a href="Hurrians">Hurrian</a> god of sky and storm. It is known from <a href="Hittite%20cuneiform">Hittite cuneiform</a> tablets found at Çorum-Boğazköy, the former Hittite capital <a href="Hattusa">Hattusa</a>. The context is a ritual of the <a href="Hattians">Hattian</a> spring festival of "<a href="Puruli">Puruli</a>".
The myth is found in "<a href="Catalogue%20des%20Textes%20Hittites">Catalogue des Textes Hittites</a>" 321, which gives two consecutive versions.
See also <a href="Eel%23Etymology">Etymology of eel</a>. "Illuyanka" is probably a compound, consisting of two words for "snake", <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> "*h₁illu-" and "*h₂engeh₂-". The same compound members, inverted, appear in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "<a href="Anguillidae">anguilla</a>" "eel". The "*h₁illu-" word is cognate to English "<a href="eel">eel</a>", the "anka-" word to <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "<a href="Vritra">ahi</a>". Also this dragon is known as Illujanka and Illuyankas.
In the first version, the two gods fight and Illuyanka wins. Teshub then goes to the Hattian goddess <a href="Inara%20%28goddess%29">Inara</a>s for advice. Having promised her love to a mortal named Hupasiyas in return for his help, she devises a trap for the dragon. She goes to him with large quantities of food and <a href="fermented%20drink">drink</a>, and entices him to drink his fill. Once drunk, the dragon is bound by Hupasiyas with a rope. Then the Sky God Teshub appears with the other gods and kills the dragon.
In the second version, after the two gods fight and Teshub loses, Illuyanka takes Teshub's eyes and heart. To avenge himself upon the dragon, the Sky God Teshub marries the goddess <a href="Hebat">Hebat</a>, daughter of a mortal, named Arm. They have a son, <a href="Sarruma">Sarruma</a>, who grows up and marries the daughter of the dragon Illuyanka. The Sky God Teshub tells his son to ask for the return of Teshub's eyes and heart as a wedding gift, and he does so. His eyes and heart restored, Teshub goes to face the dragon Illuyanka once more. At the point of vanquishing the dragon, Sarruma finds out about the battle and realizes that he had been used for this purpose. He demands that his father take his life along with Illuyanka's, and so Teshub kills them both with thundery rain and lightning. This version is illustrated on a relief which was discovered at <a href="Malatya">Malatya</a> (dating from 1050-850 BC) and is on display in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Anatolian%20Civilizations">Museum of Anatolian Civilizations</a> in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, Turkey.
The Hittite texts were introduced in 1930 by W. Porzig, who first made the comparison of Teshub's battle with Illuyankas with the sky-god <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>' battle with serpent-like <a href="Typhon">Typhon</a>, told in Pseudo-Apollodorus, "<a href="Bibliotheke">Bibliotheke</a>" (I.6.3); the Hittite-Greek parallels found few adherents at the time, the Hittite myth of the castration of the god of heaven by <a href="Kumarbi">Kumarbi</a>, with its clearer parallels to Greek myth, not having yet been deciphered and edited.
"Catalogue des Textes Hittites" 321 consists of the following tablets (Beckman 1982, p. 12):

Royal Ranger Regiment

The Royal Ranger Regiment (; RRD) is an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> regiment of the <a href="Malaysian%20Army">Malaysian Army</a>. Although it is second in seniority to the <a href="Royal%20Malay%20Regiment">Royal Malay Regiment</a> ("Rejimen Askar Melayu DiRaja; RAMD"), the RRD can trace its origins back to the mid 19th century and the establishment of <a href="The%20Sarawak%20Rangers">The Sarawak Rangers</a>, the <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> force in the <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> region. This force was absorbed by the Sarawak Constabulary in 1932, but the name was revived in 1941 as a British Colonial unit; this unit commanded by British Lieutenant Colonel C.M. Lane was captured by the Japanese in 1942.
In 1948, at the beginning of the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, groups of <a href="Iban%20people">Iban</a> trackers were recruited to help in the defence against the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Malaya">Communist Party of Malaya</a>. These Iban trackers were organised into a regimental formation as the <a href="Sarawak%20Rangers">Sarawak Rangers</a> in 1953. Prior to 1963, they were attached as scouts to many British units serving in Malaya. One of the trackers, Awang anak Rawang was awarded the <a href="George%20Cross">George Cross</a> on 20 November 1951, during his attachment to the <a href="Worcestershire%20Regiment">Worcestershire Regiment</a>.
In 1963, following the formation of <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> on 16 September of that year, the unit was transferred from the British Colonial Forces to the new <a href="Malaysian%20Army">Malaysian Army</a> and expanded into a multi-battalion, multi-ethnic regiment named Renjer Malaysia. This became the Rejimen Renjer in 1971, before being given the 'Royal' prefix and hence known as the Rejimen Renjer DiRaja (Royal Ranger Regiment) in 1992.
On 28 September 2013, Royal Ranger Regiment celebrates its Golden Jubilee.
The RRD is organised in the same way as the RAMD and currently consists of ten <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s,
The 1st to 6th, and the 9th and 10th are <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> battalions.
The 7th Ranger Battalion is presently configured as a <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> battalion and is equipped with tracked <a href="ACV%20300">ACV 300 Adnan</a> <a href="IFV">IFV</a>s, some of which are armed with <a href="Bushmaster%20Firearms%20International">Bushmaster</a> 25 mm guns.
The 8th Ranger Battalion is one of the three <a href="airborne%20forces">airborne infantry</a> battalions that form the <a href="10%20Paratrooper%20Brigade">10 Para Brigade</a>, the element of the Army's <a href="Rapid%20Deployment%20Force">Pasukan Atur Cepat</a>.
<a href="Sirajuddin%20of%20Perlis">DYMM Tuanku Syed Sirajudin Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Syed Putra Jamalullail</a>, formerly the King or <a href="Yang%20Di-Pertuan%20Agong">Yang Di-Pertuan Agong</a> of Malaysia, and <a href="Raja">Raja</a> of <a href="Perlis">Perlis</a> is the <a href="Colonel%20in%20Chief">Colonel in Chief</a> of the regiment.
The current Chairman of the Corps is lieutenant General Dato' Mohd Zaki bin Hj Mokhtar.
Rejimen Renjer DiRaja is the only regiment or corps in the Malaysian Army that is authorised to wear the black <a href="hackle">hackle</a> as part of their uniform. Also, unlike other units, the No.3 uniform (office duty) has black buttons and Gun Metal pips instead of the standard green buttons and pips of the Malaysian Army.
Unlike in other units of the Malaysian Army, a private-rank soldier in the Rangers battalion is addressed as 'Ranger.' In the Rejimen Gerak Khas, a commando formation, a private is addressed as <a href="Trooper%20%28rank%29">Trooper</a> as well as in the Royal Armoured Corps. In the Royal Engineers Regiment, a private is known as <a href="Sapper">Sapper</a>, while in the Royal Artillery Regiments a private is addressed as <a href="Gunner%20%28rank%29">Gunner</a>. For the rest of the Malaysian Army, a private-rank soldier is addressed as <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">Private</a>.
The motto of the Ranger Regiment is "Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban." A direct translation, word for word from Iban to English is "Still Alive, Still Fight." In spirit the motto means "Fight to the Death." It is conjectured that the motto was derived from Brooke family's Latin motto, "<a href="Dum%20Spiro%20Spero">Dum Spiro Spero</a>" which means "While I Breathe, I Hope." In this light, "Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban" could mean "While I Breathe, I fight." "Dum Spiro Spero" was the state motto for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sarawak">Kingdom of Sarawak</a>. In the other, according to the Journal of 1st Ranger Regiment, the motto "Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban" was derived from "Whilst There Is Life, There Is Fight", also noted as Brooke's family motto.
Others attributed the motto to that of Panglima Rentap, the legendary Malaysian Freedom Frighter. Rentap's battle cry was "Agi Idup, Agi Ngelaban!" which means "I will fight (the British Colonialist) as long as I will live". The Royal Ranger Regiment is the only corps of the Malaysian Armed Forces using this motto in the Iban language.
As an infantry regiment whose recruits are drawn from every race and pribumi (native) group of Malaysia, Rejimen Renjer Malaysia is rich with cultural heritage. The "Ngajat", the Iban Warrior Dance of the <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayak</a> community is now part of the regimental drill used to welcome visiting dignitaries. The adoption of this warrior dance as part of the regimental culture is due to the fact that this reincarnated unit of the <a href="Sarawak%20Rangers">Sarawak Rangers</a> was once almost exclusively filled in the ranks by Iban soldiers.
Col.(R) Dunstan Nyaring Angking of 1 Renjer was the first native Iban officer to attain the rank of full colonel in the Malaysian army. He served with 1 Renjer during the Indonesian confrontation and was the ensign that received on behalf of his battalion, the battalion's Battle Truncheon. The Battle Truncheon was presented by the Governor of Sarawak, Tun Abang Haji Openg Bin Abang Sapi'ee on 19 November 1966 in Lundu, First Division, Sarawak. In his address to the battalion, he had this to say amongst other things:
"This TRUNCHEON which is presented to you is an emblem from the State Government. It is also a mark of appreciation of the Government and the people of Sarawak for your services to the country and for the worthy upholding of the best tradition of our people. This a great honour earned through your conduct, bearing and bravery in battle every-where you are called upon to serve".
Currently, Brigadier General Datuk Stephen Mundaw from Pakit, Sri Aman, Sarawak is the only known highest native Iban officer serving the Malaysian Army as a Brigadier General. On 1 November 2010, he became the first native Iban officer to be appointed as Brigadier General. Apart from that, another known Dayak officer is Lt. Col. Jimbai Bunsu PBK, currently a 2nd I/C of the 1st Bn/511th Regiment TA based in Kuching.
The other well known native Iban officers are Lt. Col.(R) Robert Rizal Abdullah @ Robert Madang PGB PBK from Lachau, Sri Aman and Lt. Col.(R) James Tomlow ak Isa and Lt. Col.(R) Linus Lunsong, who later became first Iban to command 22nd Malaysian Special Forces.
A known Malay officer from Sarawak to have commanded the Ranger regiment as Commanding Officer, was Lt. Col (R) Abang Hamdan Bin Abang Hadari. Another Sarawakian Malay officer, Capt.(R) Ahmad Johan, later became well known businessman and now known as Tan Sri Ahmad Johan,Chairman of National Aerospace and Defense Industries Sdn.Bhd (NADI).
Following the terms of the Defence Agreement, Britain had agreed to raise, train and maintain one infantry Battalion, each from Sabah and Sarawak. HQ Malaya Command Ranger Group was formed and headed by Colonel I.G. Wellstead to co-ordinate and implement this clause of the agreement.
The First Battalion Malaysian Rangers, was formed on 16 September 1963 at Baird Camp, Ulu Tiram, Johore – the same camp occupied by the Sarawak Rangers. Lt. Col E. Gopsill OBE, DSO, MC of the 7th Gurkha Rifles was appointed the Commanding Officer.
The Sarawak Rangers disbanded on 15 September 1963 and was absorbed – approximately 100 strong – into the new battalion. Amongst them was Lt. James Tomlow ak Isa who was originally granted a Governor's Commission in the Sarawak Rangers was subsequently granted the Regular Commission by the Agong.
In October 1963, the nucleus of the Battalion moved out of Baird Camp to Kandy Lines, Trg Depot BDE of Gurkhas at Sungai Petani to prepare and conduct recruit training and continuity training for the new intakes. The recruits went through about four months of basic individual training followed by another two months continuity training.
Initially, this British Colonial battalion was almost exclusively composed of Sea Dayak (Iban) soldiers[ <a href="http%3A//3.bp.blogspot.com/_-40Dlk-oA34/SofiAf8EUyI/AAAAAAAABD4/ZyXa7O2jG9c/s1600-h/No.%2B2%2BPlatoon%2BSarawak%2BRangers%2B11%2BMarcg%2B1953.JPG"></a> ]Sarawak Rangers]and a small number of Malay and Indian officers. On the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963, the <a href="Sarawak%20Rangers">Sarawak Rangers</a> was disbanded and absorbed into the Malaysian Armed Forces. The 1st Battalion is the premier battalion and remains the icon of the Ranger Corps. Prior to the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the Sarawak Rangers gained their fearsome reputation during the Malayan Emergency. Concurrently, during the post-colonial reconstruction era, the 1st Battalion fought on extensively against the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM), Clandestine Communist Organization (CCO) the military arm of the Sarawak United People's Party (<a href="Sarawak%20United%20Peoples%27%20Party">SUPP</a>) and its affiliate the Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara (PARAKU, the armed wing of the <a href="North%20Kalimantan%20Communist%20Party">North Kalimantan People's Army</a>) and the Tentera Nasional Indonesia (TNI). Accounts from captured Communist Terrorists (CTs) in the '60s and '70s suggest that other than the (British Royal Marines) commandos, the CPM feared the deployment of the 1st Battalion in the immediate vicinity. The Rangers also saw action at the Malaysian-Thai border
The 1st Battalion remains an active unit of the Malaysian armed forces, although rather inexplicably, the recruitment of Iban stock has been gradually declined significantly over the last 20 years. Consequently, it's racial composition is about the same as other Malaysian infantry battalions.
It is worth noting that in the 1950s and 1960s, the British SAS were taught jungle tracking by Iban soldiers. The Ibans from the jungles of Borneo are particularly suited to jungle warfare, serving as jungle trackers for many Commonwealth battalions. Surviving and living off the land are just daily routines to these jungle soldiers. During the Malayan Emergency, Iban trackers from the previous Malayan Scouts were attached to and served in several SAS units.
This battalion is currently based in Camp Ulu Tiram, Johor Bahru, Johor.
The motto of this battalion is in Kadazan language: 'Osiou Oh Kamanang.', which means 'Who dares, Wins'. This battalion is currently based in Syed Putra Camp, Ipoh, Perak. Syed Putra Camp was previously known as Sulva Lines Camp, and has been always regarded as 'Home of the Rangers'.
The motto of this Battalion is 'Biar Putih Tulang'. This Battalion also known as 'The Red Hackles Warrior'. The 3rd Rangers was raised at the Suvla Line Camp, Ipoh, Perak on 1 Jul 1965 with the combination of the personnel from Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak (3 different area/region). This battalion is currently stationed at the Oya Camp, Sibu, Sarawak. 928133 Staff Sergeant Muit bin Ahmad, once a member of this battalion, was awarded the 'Pingat Gagah Berani” for successful actions against communist guerrillas. Lt. Col.(Rtd) Robert Rizal Abdullah won his PGB when he served in this battalion.

This battalion is currently based at Wardieburn Camp, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.
7th Renjer was formed on 10 May 1970, at Quetta Camp in Kluang, Johor with an initial batch of 202 recruits formed into 2 rifle companies. The compilement was completed with the transfer of rifle companies from each of the 8th Malay, 2nd Renjer, 3rd Renjer and 4th Renjer regiments. With the transfer of these companies, 7th Renjer achieved full regimental strength. It is the only regiment converted to 'Mechanised Battalion'. This Regiment was badly bloodied in a communist guerrilla ambush on 26 March 1972 along the Biawak / Lundu road, Sarawak. In a follow-up operation they avenged their fallen comrades and extracted heavy retributions from the communist guerrillas responsible for the ambush. This battalion is currently based at Batu Lima Camp, Mentakab, Pahang. This battalion has successfully engaged the communist guerrillas in several search and destroy operations.
8th Rangers was formed on 1 March 1973, 3 years after the formation of 7th Rangers. 8th Rangers was raised as the first parachute infantry battalion in the Malaysian Army, and achieved operational status on 1 July 1990 as a component of the elite 10 Paratroop Brigade (Malaysia).
8th Rangers gained fame during the communist Insurgency in the 1970s and 1980s. 8th Rangers engaged in several search and destroy missions against Communist Terrorists in Sarawak. From 1977, the battalion was particularly successful against Communist Terrorists in search and destroy missions in the <a href="Hulu%20Perak">Hulu Perak</a>, <a href="Kinta%20District">Kinta</a> and <a href="Kuala%20Kangsar">Kuala Kangsar</a> regions in Perak.

The 9th Battalion of the Ranger Regiment originated from the 14th Malaysian Territorial Army Battalion, which was formed on 1 April 1971 in Tawau, Sabah. The members of this battalion were locals who were members of the Local Defence Force. The unit was raised at the request of the Sabah State Government who insisted that the unit must be exclusively Sabahans. The Malaysian Army gladly complied with this opportunity by converting the 14th Territorial Battalion into a regular unit in the form of 9th Rangers on 1 March 1979, at the Batu Uban Camp in Penang. The motto of this new Ranger battalion is “Sian Bani Manang”, which in the Bajau language means “Who Dares Wins".
This battalion is currently based in Taiping, Perak; and on 28 September 2013, the Golden Jubilee of the Royal Ranger Regiment, the battalion was officially presented with their own color.
The 10th Battalion was officially formed on New Year's Day 1980, however the battalion nucleus was only formed on 1 April 1980 at Wade Wing, KEMENTAH (Malay for MINDEF;Ministry of Defense). Upon the formation, it was based twice at Sarawak and once at Peninsula,and their bases are:
In 1995, the 10th Rangers was dissolved with the 11th Rangers due to the restructuring of the Armed Forces by year 2000. However, in 2008, the 10th Rangers was reinstated and re-stationed at Sarawak. Currently, it is based at Muara Tuang Camp Complex, Kota Samarahan; its Commanding Officer is Lt.Colonel Jamaluddin Bin Yaacob; and PW 1 Michal anak Tulih is Regimental Sergeant Major. Previously, it was based at Ria Camp, Kuching, shortly after the reinstatement of the 10th Rangers.
On 27 August 1970, in a successful ambush of communist terrorists near Tanah Hitam, Klian Intan in <a href="Perak">Perak</a>, five Communist gunmens including a branch committee member were killed, and several weapons were captured by members of 6th Battalion Ranger Regiment. Major Ismail Bin Salleh, commanding officer of Charlie Company and Second Lieutenant David Fu Chee Ming who was the platoon commander of 8 Platoon were awarded the <a href="Panglima%20Gagah%20Berani">Panglima Gagah Berani</a> on 2 June 1971.
Based on information gathered by the <a href="Malaysian%20Special%20Branch">Special Branch</a>, that 60 Communist gunmens would be infiltrating Tanah Hitam moving on to Grik, Charlie Company with a complement of three officers and 94 other ranks were tasked to lay an ambush along the infiltration route. Charlie <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">Company</a> was split into three groups, with <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">Company</a> Headquarters and 9th <a href="Platoon">Platoon</a> forming the centre blocking force, 7th <a href="Platoon">Platoon</a> to the right and 8th <a href="Platoon">Platoon</a> to the left. The groups were given two days to prepare their ambush positions and lay booby traps and <a href="M18A1%20Claymore%20Antipersonnel%20Mine">Claymore</a> mines.
On 20 August, 1st <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">Section</a> consisting of eight personnel heard the rustling of branches and bamboo being snapped by footfalls. 1st Section immediately stood to in their bunkers. Ranger Abu Bin Mat saw a gunmens on the trail, 35 meters from their bunker, a lead scout of a larger group. Ranger Abu Bin Mat and Ranger Abu Samah Bin Hj. Ibrahim who were manning the Section’s support <a href="General%20purpose%20machine%20gun">GPMG</a>, along with Lance Corporal Abdullah Bin Nawi held their fire and continued their wait. Moments later, another gunmen appeared on the trail, and joined by another two gunmens.
At 3:45 pm, Lance Corporal Abdullah detonated his Claymore mine while the <a href="General%20purpose%20machine%20gun">GPMG</a> crew opened fire, joined by the <a href="Light%20machine%20gun">LMG</a> manned by Lance Corporal Karim Bin Sidek manning the left bunker. At 4:20 pm, the communist gunmens ceased fire, even though movement could still be heard in the trail. 1st <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">Section</a> opened fire to suppress the gunmens movements. With nightfall, the communists made an attempt to retrieve their fallen comrades. Major Ismail called for close in artillery support on the trail, walking the artillery rounds close to 1st <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">Section</a>’s position. The gunmens withdrew before morning, leaving behind their dead. Searches the following morning revealed five dead gunmens.

Ford Explorer Sport Trac

The Ford Explorer Sport Trac, sometimes referred to as simply the Ford Sport Trac, is a <a href="mid-size%20car">mid-size</a> <a href="pickup%20truck%23Sport%20utility%20trucks">sport utility truck (SUT)</a> sold mostly in North America produced by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> from 2000 through 2010. The Sport Trac was based on the <a href="Ford%20Explorer">Ford Explorer</a> <a href="SUV">SUV</a> - not based on the compact <a href="Ford%20Ranger%20%28North%20America%29">Ford Ranger (North America)</a> - because it was introduced when the Explorer and Ranger platforms diverged (Explorer's chassis was a heavy duty variant of the Ranger's). The Sport Trac fell between the Ranger and <a href="Ford%20F-Series">Ford F-Series</a> in Ford's truck lineup, based on capability and price. It competed with other mid-size SUTs, trucks and SUVs, such as the mid-size <a href="Honda%20Ridgeline">Honda Ridgeline</a> SUT and even the larger <a href="pickup%20truck%23full%20size">full-size</a> <a href="Chevrolet%20Avalanche">Chevrolet Avalanche</a> SUT. During its first year on sale in the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a>, there was a waiting list of over 3 months. It was technically the first body-on-frame <a href="sport%20utility%20truck">sport utility truck</a>. The Sport Trac was a Class 2 vehicle with a <a href="Gross_vehicle_weight_rating">GVWR</a> of 6250 lbs. and a maximum <a href="Gross_combined_weight_rating">GCWR</a> of 12,000 lbs. This made it one of the more and the then most capable mid-size pickups, having a greater GVWR and GCWR than the <a href="Dodge%20Dakota">Dodge Dakota</a>, GM's <a href="GMC%20Canyon">GMC Canyon</a>/<a href="Chevrolet%20Colorado">Chevrolet Colorado</a> pickups and <a href="Toyota%20Tacoma">Toyota Tacoma</a>.
The Sport Trac was discontinued in October 2010, even though it was announced in earlier press releases that production would end in 2011, since the 2011 unibody-Ford Explorer was introduced in December 2010. The Sport Trac was sold through the 2011 calendar year as a 2010 model.
The Explorer Sport Trac was introduced in 2000 as a 2001 model. It was built on a lengthened Explorer chassis, but with a small pickup bed behind the four normal <a href="SUV">SUV</a> doors. To make up for the short box, a bed extender was available. The bed was made entirely of a plastic composite material, and a hard plastic tonneau cover was a common factory option. The tailgate was carried over from the F-150 Flare Side. The pickup had a more rugged-appearing front end, which the 2-door Explorer Sport also received. The dash and front cabin area were nearly identical to the Ranger, while the exterior used Explorer parts. Midway through the 2001 model year, the engine design was changed. The "Job 1" 4.0L SOHC featured an alloy intake manifold. This was changed to a composite manifold in June 2000, and the oil filler cap moved from the driver side to the passenger side of the engine. 
In the middle of 2002, many changes took place. First, the "Explorer" badging was removed from the doors, and the "Sport Trac" badge on the tailgate was changed from red and white plastic to chrome. Trim levels were changed XLS and XLT, and the B-pillars were now color keyed instead of black. The rear brakes were changed from drums to discs, and the fuel tank capacity was increased from 20 to 22 gallons (75.7L to 83.3L). The odometer was changed to a digital style, and the headlights dial and dimmer switch were given their own plastic plate surrounding them. For the 2004 model year, the bumpers and side skirts were changed to a darker gray color, and the option for factory color matched painted bumpers was added, as well as a new instrument cluster with digital odometer. 
The rugged look carried to the interior, where the only floor option was a full rubber covering. Carpet was not available, however berber carpet floor mats were standard. Instead of the usual sliding rear window found on most pickups, the Sport Trac had a power "Breezeway" window. The 4.0 <a href="Liter">L</a> "<a href="Ford%20Cologne%20V6%20engine%234.0">Cologne</a>" <a href="V6">V6</a> producing was the only <a href="Internal%20combustion%20engine">engine</a> option. This generation Sport Trac remained in production through June 2005, when the final 2005 model year vehicle rolled off the line. 
A new Sport Trac was released in early 2006 for the 2007 model year. It was based on the new, larger fourth generation Explorer. Unlike its predecessor, it features the 4.6 L <a href="Ford%20Modular%20engine%233-valve">24-valve Modular</a> <a href="V8%20engine">V8 engine</a> as an option. The second generation Sport Trac features an all-new reinforced frame and four-wheel <a href="independent%20suspension">independent suspension</a>, compared to the first generation. To improve safety over previous models, <a href="AdvanceTrac">AdvanceTrac</a> with <a href="Roll%20Stability%20Control">Roll Stability Control</a> has been added as standard features. The Sport Trac was available in only two trim levels (as opposed to the Explorer's four). There is no base model and no moderate luxury model, like with the Explorer. There is a mid-class model, the XLT, and a high-luxury model called the Limited. Both Limited and XLT are available on Explorer. Additional options include the <a href="Ford%20SYNC">SYNC</a> system in a new 2008 package.
A special <a href="Special%20Vehicle%20Team">SVT</a> version called the "Sport Trac Adrenalin" was planned for the 2007 model year, but was canceled. However, the Adrenalin sub-model returned for 2008 as a sportier version of the Sport Trac featuring a black-out grille and trim.

Wheatgrass

Wheatgrass is a food prepared from the <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s of the <a href="common%20wheat">common wheat</a> plant, "<a href="Triticum%20aestivum">Triticum aestivum</a>" (subspecies of the family <a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a>). It is sold either as a <a href="juice">juice</a> or powder <a href="concentrate">concentrate</a>. Wheatgrass differs from wheat <a href="malt">malt</a> in that it is served <a href="freeze-dried">freeze-dried</a> or fresh, while wheat malt is <a href="convection">convectively</a> <a href="dried">dried</a>. Wheatgrass is allowed to grow longer than malt. Like most plants, it contains <a href="chlorophyll">chlorophyll</a>, <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s, and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s. Claims about the health benefits of wheatgrass range from providing supplemental nutrition to having unique curative properties, though few, if any, have been scientifically proven. It is often available in <a href="juice%20bar">juice bar</a>s, and some consumers grow and juice wheatgrass in their homes. It is available as fresh <a href="produce">produce</a>, <a href="Tablet%20%28pharmacy%29">tablets</a>, frozen juice and <a href="powder%20%28substance%29">powder</a>. Wheatgrass is also available commercially as a spray, cream, gel, massage lotion, and a liquid herbal supplement. Because wheatgrass juice is extracted from wheatgrass sprouts, i.e., before the wheat seed begins to form, it is <a href="Gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free</a>.
Wheat grass can be traced back in history over 5000 years, to ancient Egypt and perhaps even early Mesopotamian civilizations. It is purported that ancient Egyptians found sacred the young leafy blades of wheat and prized them for their positive effect on their health and vitality.
The consumption of wheatgrass in the <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a> began in the 1930s as a result of experiments conducted by <a href="Charles%20Schnabel">Charles Schnabel</a> in his attempts to popularize the plant. By 1940, cans of Schnabel's powdered grass were on sale in major drug stores throughout the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>
<a href="Ann%20Wigmore">Ann Wigmore</a> was also a strong advocate for the consumption of wheatgrass as a part of a <a href="raw%20food%20diet">raw food diet</a>. Wigmore, founder of the Hippocrates Health Institute, believed that wheatgrass, as a part of a raw food diet, would cleanse the body of toxins while providing a proper balance of nutrients as a whole food. She also taught that wheatgrass could be used to treat those with serious disease. Wigmore's recommendations and reputation as a health practitioner have been heavily criticized, but many health institutes still endorse her teachings.
Wheatgrass can be grown indoors or outdoors. A common method for sprout production indoors is often on trays in a growth medium such as a potting mix. Leaves are harvested when they develop a "split" as another leaf emerges. These can then be cut off with scissors and allow a second crop of shoots to form. Sometimes a third cutting is possible, but may be tougher and have less sugars than the first.
Schnabel's research was conducted with wheatgrass grown outdoors in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>. His wheatgrass required 200 days of slow growth, through the winter and early spring, when it was harvested at the <a href="jointing%20stage">jointing stage</a>. He claimed that at this stage the plant reached its peak <a href="Nutritional%20rating%20systems">nutritional value</a>; after jointing, concentrations of chlorophyll, protein, and vitamins decline sharply. Wheatgrass grown is harvested, <a href="freeze%20drying">dehydrated at a low temperature</a> and sold in tablet and powdered concentrates for human and animal consumption. Indoor grown wheatgrass is used to make wheatgrass juice powder.
Proponents of wheatgrass make many claims for its health properties, ranging from promotion of general well-being to <a href="cancer%20prevention">cancer prevention</a>. However, according to the <a href="American%20Cancer%20Society">American Cancer Society</a>, "available scientific evidence does not support the idea that wheatgrass or the wheatgrass diet can cure or prevent disease".
A small 2002 study showed some evidence that wheatgrass might help with the symptoms of <a href="ulcerative%20colitis">ulcerative colitis</a>, but without further work the significance of this work cannot be determined. Another small 2002 study suggested wheatgrass might help with the side-effects of breast cancer chemotherapy.
Wheatgrass is a good source of <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, a very good source of <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a>, <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>, <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a> (alpha tocopherol), <a href="vitamin%20K">vitamin K</a>, <a href="thiamin">thiamin</a>, <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a>, <a href="niacin">niacin</a>, <a href="Pyridoxine">vitamin B6</a>, <a href="pantothenic%20acid">pantothenic acid</a>, <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and has a negligible amount of protein (less than one gram per 28 grams). Adding other foods with complementary amino acid profiles to this food may yield a more complete protein source and improve the quality of some types of restrictive diets.
Wheatgrass proponent <a href="Charles%20Schnabel">Charles Schnabel</a> claimed in the 1940s that "fifteen <a href="pounds%20%28mass%29">pounds</a> of wheatgrass is equal in overall nutritional value to 350 pounds of ordinary garden vegetables", a ratio of 1:23. Despite claims of vitamin and mineral content disproportional to other vegetables, the nutrient content of wheatgrass juice is roughly equivalent to that of dark leafy vegetables (see table 1).
Contrary to popular belief, vitamin B is not contained within wheat grass or any vegetable; rather it is a <a href="byproduct">byproduct</a> of the <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s living on plants. Some analyses of B content in wheatgrass has confirmed that it contains negligible amounts of the compound even though the source of this analysis remains unclear. The USDA National Nutrient Database reports that wheatgrass contains no vitamin B. Because vitamin B is not made by plants, any of this vitamin would have to be produced by bacteria found in the preparation.

Mahuri

Mahuri (माहुरी) is a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="caste">caste</a> (<a href="j%C4%81ti">jāti</a>) under <a href="Vaisya">Vaisya</a> <a href="varna%20%28Hinduism%29">varna</a>.
Mahuri Vaisya people are reported to have migrated from the city of <a href="Mathura%2C%20Uttar%20Pradesh">Mathura</a> and surrounding rural locations to the then suba of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> under the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. As a faithful community, the Mahuri Vaisya community still continue to worship "Mata Mathurashani Devi", an incarnation of <a href="Shakti">Shakti</a>, as their family deity.
In a part of the <a href="Bhagavata%20Purana">Bhagavata Purana</a>, which is named "Sukha Sagar" (that is, the Ocean of Bliss), there is a <a href="Hindu%20mythology">mythical</a> story which states that <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a> felt that the <a href="Avatar">Avatar</a> (incarnation) of <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> had already taken place on the earth (<a href="Prithvi">Prithvi</a>). He dispatched an emissary to Mathura region to ascertain the factual position. There the emissary found that Krishna was moving around with Gopas and <a href="Gopi">Gopi</a>s in and around <a href="Vrindavan">Vrindavan</a>. After some time, Krishna went somewhere, leaving the Gopas and Gopis alone for sometime. During Krishna's absence, Brahma's emissary put all the Gopas and Gopis inside a cave and closed the opening of the cave. Upon his return, when Krishna found that all the Gopas and Gopis had disappeared, he, by his divine power, created duplicates of them, and sent them to their respective homes.
After some time, the real Gopas and Gopis could come out of the cave, and when they reached their homes, they found their identical figures occupying the houses. Somehow, they evicted them from their houses. Now, the Gopas and Gopis created of Krishna's divine <a href="Maya%20%28illusion%29">maya</a> came to him, and prayed for shelter. Krishna advised them to reside in the fourteen forest hamlets around Vrindavan, and directed them that for livelihood they should engage themselves in trade and commerce.
It is believed by some of the Mahuri people that these Gopas and Gopis created by the divine maya of Krishna are their ancestors, and Mahuri people derive their surnames, as described below, from the names of the forest hamlets where they had originally settled as directed by Krishna.
The Mahuri Vaisya have 14 <a href="surnames">surnames</a> (<a href="family%20names">family names</a>), each with a different <a href="gotra">gotra</a>.
It is believed that Lord <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> advised the ancient ancestors of the Mahuri to engage themselves in trade and commerce—that is, to take up the ways of the <a href="Vaisya">Vaisya</a>—in order to earn their livelihood. They settled in fourteen hamlets nestled in the forests of <a href="Vrindavana">Vrindavana</a> (now <a href="Vrindavan">Vrindavan</a>) around the ancient city of <a href="Mathura%2C%20Uttar%20Pradesh">Mathura</a>, whence the name "Mahuri". The fourteen original Mahuri surnames or family names (referred to by modern Mahuri Vaisya as "khatas") are derived from the names of these forest hamlets.
Although the history of Mahuri Vaisya is traceable to a very near term to hardly three centuries or so, the family <a href="folklore">folklore</a>s of Mahuri Vaisya people as well as certain <a href="mythological">mythological</a> and <a href="historical">historical</a> evidences suggest that roots of the Mahuri Vaisya (not necessarily with the same name "mahuri") may be traced back to two millennia before—even to the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya</a> and <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta</a> periods.
Although Mahuri people have been coming to places in the Suba of Bengal during the heyday of the Mughal Empire (around 500 years before) for trade and commerce, the large waves of migrations reportedly took place around 250 years before. Scores of families reached the place <a href="Bihar-E-Sharif">Bihar-E-Sharif</a> located in the present day state of <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a>, India. Over a period of several decades, the Mahuri Vaishya folks reached the <a href="hinterland">hinterland</a> of <a href="Chota%20Nagpur%20Plateau">Chota Nagpur Plateau</a> (or Chhota Nagpur) and got located in a number of villages.
Before this, they had already settled in several fertile locations of the areas of the <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>. Ultimately, the heritage city of <a href="Gaya%2C%20India">Gaya</a>, in several senses, emerged as the "capital city" of all the Mahuri Vaisya people. From the early 20th Century, several mahuri families migrated to the places located in the present day states of the <a href="West%20Bengal">West Bengal</a> and <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a>. By the end of the last century, the dynamism of the Mahuri Vaishya took them to several parts of India, particularly to the metropolitan cities of <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> and <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. Now, Mahuri Vaisya families may be found, albeit in a very small number, in almost all the <a href="time%20zones">time zones</a> across the globe. A number of them have also shed their traditional vocation of trade and commerce, and are engaged in a variety of other professions.

Trade paperback (comics)

In <a href="comics">comics</a>, a trade paperback (often shortened to TPB, TP or trade) is a collection of stories originally published in <a href="American%20comic%20books">comic books</a>, reprinted in book format, usually capturing one <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> from a single title or a series of stories with a connected story arc or common theme from one or more titles. Although "<a href="Paperback%23Trade%20paperback">trade paperback</a>" is actually a publishing term that refers to any book with a flexible cardstock cover which is larger than the standard <a href="paperback">mass market paperback</a> format, comics fans unfamiliar with that meaning have come to use the term to refer to the type of material traditionally sold in comics shops in that format: collected editions of previously serialized stories. The term <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> is sometimes used interchangeably, but some people maintain that the terms are distinct, with the difference being that the latter term refers to a square-bound printing with largely original material.
Traditionally, a trade paperback will reproduce the stories at the same size as they were originally presented in comic book format. However, certain trades have been published in a smaller, "<a href="digest-sized">digest-sized</a>" format, similar in size to a paperback novel. Other works (usually material likely to sell well) are published in a "larger"-than-original hardcover format. They are also floppy and soft.
Note that many comics collections are published in hardcover (or in both formats). The bulk of this article applies to both paperback and hardcover collections. In the comics industry, the term "trade paperback market" can be casually used to refer to the market for any collection, regardless of actual cover.
A trade paperback will sometimes feature additional artwork, such as alternative <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> or pinup galleries by guest artists, not released in the standard issues. Additional story material that was not available in the series itself may also be included, primarily "preview" or "extra" stories presented exclusively on the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> or in comics-industry publications such as "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" (or simply things that are unlikely to be reprinted anywhere else, such as <a href="Free%20Comic%20Book%20Day">Free Comic Book Day</a> comics). Many feature introductions written by prominent figures, some from outside the world of comics—for instance, "" features an introduction by <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>, the <a href="Ultimates%202">Ultimates 2</a> book has an introduction by <a href="Jonathan%20Ross%20">Jonathan Ross </a> and most "<a href="Hellboy">Hellboy</a>" trade paperbacks have included introductions by prominent authors. A common practice is to include an art gallery featuring the artwork of the original comic book covers from which the series was compiled.
While there have been exceptions, as a general <a href="rule%20of%20thumb">rule of thumb</a>, trade paperbacks will not feature advertisements, <a href="fan%20mail">fan mail</a>, special <a href="foil%20%28chemistry%29">foil</a> or <a href="Embossing%20%28paper%29">embossed</a> covers. Where the original serialized format included back-up stories not related to the main arc, these may also be omitted, and, in what is now a largely discontinued practice, it was common in older trade paperbacks to use only small excerpts from certain stories, or to omit pages from the main story related to other <a href="subplot">subplot</a>s.
For many years, trade paperbacks were mainly used to reprint older comic-book stories that were no longer available to the average reader, when original copies of those stories were scarce and hard to find, and often very expensive when found due to their rarity. However, in the first years of the 21st century, comic book publishers began releasing trade paperbacks of collected story arcs, often within a few months of those stories' publication in comic-book form (and in some cases, within the same month that the final issue was originally released). This was found to be an excellent way to draw new readers to a series—where before, one would have to hunt for individual back issues to catch up on a series, now a reader coming into an already established title could purchase the previous issues in trade paperback form and have access to the entire series' worth of stories to date.
As the trade paperback versions are usually cheaper than buying the individual comics and presented without any advertisements, many comic book fans choose to hold off on purchasing the individual issues and only follow the stories when they come out in trade. This can sometimes help a series whose sales are flagging, much like how a film that performed poorly in movie theaters can gain new popularity in home video formats; in a few instances, significant trade paperback sales have even revived a series that had been cancelled or slated for cancellation. However, only buying a series in trade format can also hurt a title; despite the growing popularity of the trade paperback, the serialized, individual issues are still considered the primary mode of sale by comics publishers, and if a series is not meeting sales criteria for individual issues, it may face cancellation no matter how well the collected editions are selling.
A significant benefit of the trade paperback version is that it is often available in bookstores, from smaller booksellers to the larger suppliers, and other retailers that do not normally carry comic books.
Unlike the individual issues, trade paperbacks usually have no particular value to collectors, as they are reprints (which lack the historical significance of the original publication), and they are often kept in print (thus readily available new). However, some trade paperbacks can themselves be noteworthy or scarce, and their value to collectors can go up substantially. Trade paperbacks and graphic novels are the preferred format for circulating library collections, since these collections are created to be read, and not to be retained as collector's items or as investments. Attempts to catalogue and circulate single-issue comics can pose difficult problems and the durability of the trade paperback format is an important consideration for longevity and collection development in public and school libraries.
There are some criticisms of trade paperbacks by some writers and artists in recent years. They argue that because of the popularity of trades that they are forced to produce five or six issue arcs simply because this is the ideal size of a trade. In their perspective this can be quite limiting in the length of a story and pacing as the size is now set. This however is also countered by placing several short arcs in one volume and in the case of longer arcs—the "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>" comic adaptation was released in two separate trades.

Proposed National Unification Promotion Law

The proposed National Unification Promotion Law of the People's Republic of China () is a document that appeared in early 2004 as a suggestion to create formal a legal basis for the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>'s <a href="Chinese%20reunification">reunification</a> with <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. It was authored by a Chinese scholar Yu Yuanzhou (余元州), a professor from the <a href="Jianghan%20University">Jianghan University</a> in <a href="Wuhan">Wuhan</a> who does not have a formal governmental position. Although no formal legislative action has been taken on the document, it was widely discussed in China. The reactions to the proposed document was mixed, with some, mainly in Taiwan, saying it provided evidence of hostile intent on the part of the PRC, while others praising it for proposing flexible solutions to the intractable conflict.
This proposal has not been directly incorporated in the bill (which later passed into law). None of the policies (e.g. the federal policy, or a new currency, see below) appeared in the final, official anti-secession law of the PRC.
Although Taiwan was ceded to Japan in the treaty of Shimonoseki ratified in 1895 – then surrendered by Japan in 1945 to the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> Administration – the PRC government considers <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> to be the 23rd province of the People's Republic of China. The historical claim is based on the formal incorporation of Taiwan into the Qing empire in 1680. From the political perspective, according to the PRC argument, the government of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> ceased to be legitimate following its retreat to Taiwan in 1949, and thus all sovereignty and governmental authority in China was automatically transferred to the PRC, including that of Taiwan which was then under ROC administration. The official ROC line counters that it did not cease to exist in 1949 and has continued to function as a sovereign political entity on Taiwan to the present day, making the relation between the PRC and ROC similar to that between other states similarly partitioned (such as <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>). The PRC's position has been acknowledged by most other nations but not formally recognized, as most nations prefer to take an ambiguous approach on the issue. See <a href="Political%20status%20of%20Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a>.
Since 1949, the PRC government has demanded that Taiwan unify under the PRC, and has reserved the right to use military force to compel Taiwan to do so if necessary. However, opinion polls conducted in Taiwan have indicated that there is very little support for unification on the PRC's terms, even among those who favor eventual unification, making peaceful unification unlikely for the foreseeable future. With the reelection of <a href="Chen%20Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> to the ROC Presidency, and the growth of <a href="Taiwan%20independence">Taiwan independence</a> sentiment, a new Taiwanese identity appears to be emerging on the island as opposed to identification with China. In 2008, the <a href="KMT">KMT</a> regained both the presidency and the legislature with a pair of election victories over the <a href="Democratic%20Progressive%20Party">DPP</a>.
In a string of unsuccessful efforts to change Taiwanese public opinion, several propositions and leaks from PRC governmental organs expressed consideration for a law aiming to formalize the policy for <a href="Chinese%20reunification">Chinese reunification</a> between <a href="mainland%20China">mainland China</a> and Taiwan under the authority of the PRC. This culminated in May 2004, when <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Premier</a> <a href="Wen%20Jiabao">Wen Jiabao</a> pronounced to a group of Chinese expatriates in <a href="London">London</a> that serious consideration of such a law would be taken. Several days later, Yu's suggestion (similar to a <a href="green%20paper">green paper</a>) emerged.
The draft document has 31 articles, organized in 8 chapters. Its provisions touch mostly <a href="constitution">constitutional law</a>.
Article 2 establishes Taiwan as the "Taiwan Special Political Area of PRC, or Taiwan SPA of PRC for short" (); this appears to be an <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">administrative division</a> of the PRC distinct from the <a href="Special%20Administrative%20Region%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Special Administrative Region</a> espoused by the PRC government for Taiwan. Curiously, it allows Chinese people loyal (or having affinity) to the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> to transiently view the mainland as "The Mainland Special Political Area of ROC, or The Mainland SPA of ROC" (中華民國大陸特別政治區). Article 3 reiterated the PRC's aim to implement the '<a href="one%20country%2C%20two%20systems">one country, two systems</a>' policy for Taiwan, which would be brought into reality with military force if necessary.
Article 8 exempts Taiwan from any PRC imposed taxes. Chapter 3 proposes the establishment of a new, common <a href="currency">currency</a> called the Chinese dollar set by <a href="fiat%20currency">fiat</a> to be worth 0.1 <a href="gram">gram</a>s of <a href="gold">gold</a> forever.
Two methods of unification are laid out as options: Constitutional arrangement for peaceful unification is contained in Chapter 4: the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China">Constitution of the Republic of China</a> which is used in Taiwan is said to be obsolete; a <a href="federation">federation</a> is proposed. Chapter 5 provides the legal basis for non-peaceful (<a href="Military%20of%20China">military</a>) methods of unification. The conditions for the use of armed force are set out, and explicitly states that the PRC may not limit itself to the use of conventional weapons, implying the use of <a href="weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>. Article 18 also stipulates that Taiwan will be subject to attack should it defy policy set by the PRC government.
Chapter 6 provides for honours for those promoting unification, whereas Chapter 7 sets out criminal penalties against separatism—limited to acts carried out within Chinese territory, and acts carried out anywhere by Chinese residents in the Mainland, <a href="Macau">Macau</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and Taiwan.
Article 30, section 1 provides that the law and subsequent changes thereof are to be carried out by the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Congress">National People's Congress</a> and signed into force by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">President of the People's Republic of China</a>—parenthetically, 'Head of State', probably to infer the possibility of a different position once the law takes effect; section 2 provides that permanent sections of the law cannot be changed unless later agreements contain promises that are 'more favourable' (更加优惠, but the beneficiary is unspecified); section 3 states that the law is lower than the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Constitution of the People's Republic of China</a> but higher than any other laws of the land.
<a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China">The ROC President</a> <a href="Chen%20Shui-bian">Chen Shui-bian</a> has expressed serious concerns about this proposal, and has expressed doubts that the Taiwanese public would find it acceptable. Chen also pointed out that the law being proposed is mostly intended as a measure to legitimize the PRC's military threats against the ROC. Furthermore, the proposed law would incriminate anyone holding opinions other than those supporting PRC policy on the question of reunification. Under the law dissidents would be prosecuted under charges of treason, retroactively effective up to 100 years, raising serious questions about <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>. Chen stated that the law would only serve to increase the feelings of animosity of the Taiwanese people towards the PRC and increase tensions.
It is worth noting that the PRC's "<a href="one%20country%2C%20two%20systems">one country, two systems</a>" policy has been shown to be approved by less than 10% of Taiwan residents in multiple recent opinion polls. Moreover, many people also questioned how a proposed PRC law could be applied onto a territory over which the PRC does not have <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. Even though few states formally recognize the ROC as an independent country, most prefer to remain ambiguous over the matter. The <a href="Political%20status%20of%20Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a> is still an ongoing multilateral dispute.
It has been unclear as to the degree to which this law is or was ever taken seriously by PRC authorities. The law
was proposed by an individual without any governmental authority, and no formal action on the law has ever been taken by the <a href="National%20People%27s%20Congress">National People's Congress</a>. After summer 2004, references to the proposed law on both sides of the straits became rare, leading many to conclude that it was released by the PRC mainly to gauge public opinion. Shortly after this proposal, the PRC enacted the <a href="Anti-Secession%20Law">Anti-Secession Law</a>.

Kakha Kaladze

Kakhaber "Kakha" Kaladze ( ; born 27 February 1978) is a <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a> politician and retired <a href="Association%20football">footballer</a>. He played for the <a href="Georgia%20national%20football%20team">Georgia national team</a> from 1996 to 2011. He was voted <a href="Georgian%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Georgian Footballer of the Year</a> in 2001–2003, and 2006 and was considered as one of Georgia's most important players.
Kaladze started his football career in 1993 at <a href="Umaglesi%20Liga">Umaglesi Liga</a> club <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">Dinamo Tbilisi</a> and made 82 appearances in a five-year spell. In 1998, he moved to the <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> club <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> and made 71 appearances until 2001, when he was signed by the Italian <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> club <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a>. He has won one Serie A, three <a href="Ukrainian%20Premier%20League">Ukrainian Premier League</a> and five Umaglesi Liga titles. With Milan he won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> on two occasions, the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> once and the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> once. After captaining his country 50 times in 84 appearances, Kaladze announced his retirement from the Georgian national team on 11 December 2011. 
Born in <a href="Samtredia">Samtredia</a>, a town in <a href="Imereti">Imereti Province</a>, Kaladze comes from a footballing family as his father played for <a href="FC%20Samtredia">Lokomotiv Samtredia</a> and was also president of the team for some time. His brother was kidnapped in a high-profile case in 2001 and officially declared dead in 2006, resulting in two men being sentenced to <a href="prison">prison</a> for a combined total of 30 years. Outside of football he owns a company called Kala Capital and an organisation called Kala Foundation as well as being an ambassador for <a href="SOS%20Children%27s%20Villages">SOS Children's Villages</a>. He is married to Anouki Areshidze and they have three children.
Kaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition <a href="Georgian%20Dream%E2%80%93Democratic%20Georgia">Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia</a> party founded by <a href="Bidzina%20Ivanishvili">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> in February 2012. He was elected to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Georgia">Parliament of Georgia</a> on October 1, 2012, and approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as <a href="Ministry%20of%20Energy%20%28Georgia%29">Minister of Energy</a> in the <a href="cabinet%20of%20Bidzina%20Ivanishvili">cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> on October 25, 2012.
Kaladze started his career playing as a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker">striker</a> for his local club <a href="FC%20Samtredia">Lokomotiv Samtredia</a>, where his father was president, until former Georgia international footballer <a href="David%20Kipiani">David Kipiani</a> requested Kakha to join <a href="FC%20Dinamo%20Tbilisi">Dinamo Tbilisi</a>. At Dinamo Tbilisi, he played in 82 domestic league games and scored one goal. He made his top-flight debut as a 16-year-old with Dinamo Tbilisi during the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Umaglesi%20Liga">1993–94 campaign</a>. Kaladze claims that a good performance against <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> while playing for Georgia in a match that ended 0–0 brought him to the attention of <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>, "In that game I was up against <a href="Christian%20Vieri">Christian Vieri</a> and I <a href="Man-to-man%20marking">marked</a> him well."
A fee equivalent to €280,000 was enough to take him to the <a href="Ukrainian%20Premier%20League">Ukrainian Premier League</a> and Dynamo Kyiv in January 1998, where he signed a four-year deal. Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two and a half seasons he spent there. The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of <a href="Hryhoriy%20Surkis">Hryhoriy Surkis</a> and the late <a href="Valeriy%20Lobanovskyi">Valeriy Lobanovskyi</a> had just been installed as <a href="Coach%20%28sport%29">manager</a>, they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles. Kaladze also appeared in <a href="Two-legged%20tie">both legs</a> of the semi-final of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">1998–99 Champions League</a> against <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, which Dynamo Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate. On the way to the semi-finals, they beat teams like <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. He won eight league titles in a row during his time at Dinamo Tbilisi and Dynamo Kyiv.
In 2001, Kaladze became the most expensive Georgian footballer in history when AC Milan paid €16m to bring him to Italy. He cited an injury to <a href="Aleksei%20Gerasimenko">Aleksei Gerasimenko</a> as his reason for leaving. At first, Kaladze was tried in different positions and faced competition for places in defense from players such as <a href="Jaap%20Stam">Jaap Stam</a> and <a href="Cafu">Cafu</a>. In the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Serie%20A">2002–03 season</a>, however, he made 46 appearances in all competitions including 27 league appearances. That year Milan won the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League%202002%E2%80%9303">Champions League</a>, where they beat <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a> in the <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a> (despite Kaladze missing his penalty) and the <a href="Coppa%20Italia%202002%E2%80%9303">Coppa Italia</a> where they beat <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a> 6–3 on <a href="Two-legged%20tie">aggregate</a> in the final. After Kaladze's <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> success, the Georgian postal service issued a special <a href="Postage%20stamp">stamp</a> bearing the player's image. He is the first Georgian player to win a Champions League title.
Kaladze was limited to just six league appearances and 11 total appearances in the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Serie%20A">2003–04 season</a>. In the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Serie%20A">next season</a>, Kaladze played just 19 Serie A matches and five in the Champions League as Milan finished as runners-up in both competitions. He was an unused <a href="Substitute%20%28association%20football%29">substitute</a> in that season's <a href="2005%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">Champions League final</a> where Milan lost on penalties to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> after a 3–3 draw. He was said to be frustrated with his lack of first team options and a move to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, in exchange for <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Crespo">Hernán Crespo</a> or for £4m, was widely reported. Kaladze himself said, "I have agreed everything with the Chelsea management. Now it is necessary to wait for them to reach an agreement with Milan and I think I could become a Chelsea player next week." Chelsea opted to sign <a href="Asier%20del%20Horno">Asier del Horno</a> instead and Kaladze later declared himself "glad" that the deal fell through. On 30 June 2005, he extended his contract with Milan until 2010 and again on 4 September 2006, this time until 2011. In <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A">2005–06</a>, the injury of <a href="Paolo%20Maldini">Paolo Maldini</a> meant that Kaladze was moved back into the centre of defence, his favoured position. Milan finished third that season although they would have finished second if there were no <a href="2006%20Italian%20football%20scandal">2006 Italian football scandal</a> which resulted in a 30-point deduction.
In the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Serie%20A">2006–07 Serie A campaign</a>, Kaladze scored a goal against <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a> which turned out to be his only goal of the season. Milan finished in fourth place with an eight-point deduction relating to the previous season's scandal. Kaladze won his second Champions League title on 23 May 2007 after Milan beat Liverpool 2–1 in the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>; he came on as a 79th-minute substitute in that match. He later picked up the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> in December that year where Milan beat <a href="Boca%20Juniors">Boca Juniors</a> 4–2 in the <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">final</a>, however Kaladze was one of two players to be <a href="sent%20off">sent off</a> in that match. He had established himself as a <a href="first%20team">first team</a> regular in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Serie%20A">2007–08 season</a>, making 32 appearances, but had only featured sparingly in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Serie%20A">2008–09 season</a> due to a <a href="knee">knee</a> <a href="ligament">ligament</a> injury sustained in a <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> match against <a href="FC%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Kaladze's performance in the 15 February 2009 <a href="Derby%20della%20Madonnina">Milan derby</a> was described as a "horror show" on the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> website which started a dispute over an alleged <a href="smear%20campaign">smear campaign</a> between Kaladze and the Georgian newspaper Lelo, who used the quote, "Milan really does need a new centre-back after Kakha Kaladze’s horror show in the derby". AC Milan finished third in the league that season, 10 points behind the leader <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> and Kaladze believed this was caused by the many injuries in the squad.
On 31 August 2010, Kaladze signed with Genoa. Milan later revealed that it was a free transfer. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Serie%20A">2010–11 season</a>, he played 26 matches scored one goal which was against <a href="Parma%20F.C.">Parma</a> on 30 January 2011. He was named as second-best defender of the season 2010–11 Serie A by <a href="La%20Gazzetta%20dello%20Sport">La Gazzetta dello Sport</a>, being surpassed only by his former teammate <a href="Thiago%20Emiliano%20da%20Silva">Thiago Silva</a> of <a href="A.C.%20Milan">AC Milan</a>. On 12 May 2012, Kaladze announced his retirement from football.
Kaladze won his first <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a> against <a href="Cyprus%20national%20football%20team">Cyprus</a> in a <a href="Exhibition%20match">friendly match</a> on 27 March 1996, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for <a href="Mikhail%20Kavelashvili">Mikhail Kavelashvili</a>. Later that year, he was sent off for the first time in his international career against <a href="Lebanon%20national%20football%20team">Lebanon</a> in a friendly match. He subsequently featured in his country's qualifying campaigns for the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">1998</a>, <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">2002</a>, <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">2006</a> and <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">2010 FIFA World Cups</a>, and the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20qualifying">2000</a>, <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004%20qualifying">2004</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008%20qualifying">2008 UEFA European Championships</a>. Georgia, however, have never qualified for the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> or the <a href="UEFA%20European%20Football%20Championship">UEFA European Championship</a> since they split from the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a>. His competitive debut was against <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland</a> on 14 June 1997 in a 1998 World Cup qualifier, Georgia lost the match 4–1. Just two matches later, Kaladze was sent off for the second time playing for Georgia, along with <a href="Georgi%20Kinkladze">Georgi Kinkladze</a>, against <a href="Moldova%20national%20football%20team">Moldova</a> in another 1998 World Cup qualifier. Georgia finished in fourth place in the group and failed to qualify. In qualifying for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">Euro 2000</a>, Georgia finished at the bottom of the group (<a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20qualifying%20Group%202">Group 2</a>), in sixth place, with just one win. Kaladze occasionally captained the side during these qualifiers in the absence of <a href="Georgi%20Nemsadze">Georgi Nemsadze</a>.
The qualifiers for the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 World Cup</a> ended with Georgia finishing in third place, ahead of <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungary</a> and <a href="Lithuania%20national%20football%20team">Lithuania</a>. Kaladze played in all of the matches and often missed the friendlies in between. Kaladze only played in three matches during the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a> qualifiers, where Georgia finished in last place in the group. He did, however, feature in a 1–0 victory over neighbouring <a href="Russia%20national%20football%20team">Russia</a> which is considered to be one of Georgia's greatest successes. Kaladze played in all bar one of the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a> qualifying matches, where Georgia finished sixth in the group, with <a href="Kazakhstan%20national%20football%20team">Kazakhstan</a> being the only team to finish below them. He played fewer matches during the qualification for <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">Euro 2008</a> and once again Georgia failed to qualify as they finished in sixth place despite starting their campaign with a 6–0 win over the <a href="Faroe%20Islands%20national%20football%20team">Faroe Islands</a>.
He scored his first ever international goal against <a href="Latvia%20national%20football%20team">Latvia</a> on 6 February 2008 in a friendly which Georgia lost 3–1. On 5 September 2009, Kaladze scored two <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a>s in a <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a> qualifying match against <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> within the space of 11 minutes. The match ended 2–0 to Italy. Kaladze was the <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> of the national team, until 11 December 2011, when he announced his retirement.
As many footballers, Kaladze appeared in various publicity and advertising capacities, capitalizing on his popularity as an Italian club footballer.
In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, a <a href="Medicine">medical</a> student, was <a href="Kidnapping">kidnapped</a> in Georgia, with a <a href="ransom">ransom</a> of $600,000 demanded. <a href="President%20of%20Georgia">Georgia's president</a> at the time, <a href="Eduard%20Shevardnadze">Eduard Shevardnadze</a> promised that "everything is being done to locate him“. Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown <a href="blindfold">blindfold</a>ed and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision stating, "There was a time when I thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn’t do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support." Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian <a href="police">police</a> officers found eight dead bodies in the <a href="Svaneti">Svaneti</a> region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006 Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.
Kaladze has also been active in charitable causes and is a FIFA ambassador for the <a href="SOS%20Children%27s%20Villages">SOS Children's Villages</a>. Through his Kala Foundation, a charitable organisation established in 2008, Kaladze raised €50,000 to benefit <a href="South%20Ossetia">South Ossetia</a>n refugees during the <a href="2008%20Georgia%E2%80%93Russia%20crisis">Russian invasion of Georgia</a>. Kaladze also plans to release an <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> with the proceeds going to the Kala Foundation.
Along with his football career, Kaladze is an investor in Georgia, Italy, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. Kaladze owns Kala Capital, an investment company established in 2008 in Georgia with a focus on energy businesses, and whose chief executive is former Georgian Prime Minister <a href="Zurab%20Noghaideli">Zurab Noghaideli</a>.
Kaladze's other businesses include the <a href="Buddha%20Bar">Buddha Bar</a> in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> that opened in 2008. Kaladze is also the owner of a restaurant called Giannino, founded in 1899 by Giannino Bindi, which is based in Milan. The restaurant has had a <a href="Michelin%20Guide">Michelin star</a> under Davide Oldani.
Kala Capital owned 45 percent of the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company incorporated in Georgia in 1998. His candidacy as <a href="Ministry%20of%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20%28Georgia%29">Minister of Energy and Natural Resources</a> in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise. Reports on the same day indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia Hydropower Construction Company within 10 days of his appointment.
Kaladze became involved in the politics of Georgia as a member of the opposition <a href="Georgian%20Dream%E2%80%93Democratic%20Georgia">Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia</a> party founded by <a href="billionaire">billionaire</a> <a href="Bidzina%20Ivanishvili">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> in February 2012. He was elected to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Georgia">Parliament of Georgia</a> on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as <a href="Ministry%20of%20Energy%20%28Georgia%29">Minister of Energy</a> in the <a href="cabinet%20of%20Bidzina%20Ivanishvili">cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili</a> on October 25, 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia Hydropower Construction Company in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.

Carshalton Beeches railway station

Carshalton Beeches railway station is in south <a href="Carshalton">Carshalton</a> in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Sutton">London Borough of Sutton</a> in <a href="south%20London">south London</a>. The station, and all trains serving it, is operated by <a href="Southern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southern</a>, and is in <a href="Travelcard%20Zone%205">Travelcard Zone 5</a>.
The typical off-peak service from the station is:
This station also has train services to and from London Bridge Station, in the mornings (to London Bridge), and evenings (from London Bridge) on weekdays.
The railway in Carshalton Beeches has been around since 1847 when track was laid between Epsom, Sutton and West Croydon but it was not until 1 October 1906 that a halt named "Beeches Halt" was opened in the small settlement, at the north end of Beeches Avenue (at the time called Beechnut Tree Walk). That same year a tram service between Sutton and Croydon opened. Beeches Halt was served by steam rail-motors (early multiple units) running between West Croydon and Epsom Downs. 
As residential development continued, demand increased and the Sutton to London line was <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrified</a> in 1925 using 6600V, 25 Hz AC, Overhead electrification (OLE), replacing passenger steam traction. At that time the halt was upgraded, a new station built, renamed Carshalton Beeches on 1 April 1925 and the road bridge was rebuilt. The OLE was replaced by the Southern standard of 650V DC <a href="third%20rail">third rail</a> in 1930.
The station's centenary was celebrated in October 2006 and in September 2010 the station foyer was completely reworked to allow a larger ticket office and for electronic ticket barriers to be put in. These are now operational. Further work was completed in 2012 giving disabled access to the London-bound platform only and also adding an area for the parking of bicycles.

The sixteen riders raced against each other in matches of two. Qualification for the next round was not based on who won those matches, however. The cyclists with the eight fastest times advanced, regardless of whether they won or lost their match.
In the first round of actual match competition, cyclists were seeded into matches based on their times from the qualifying round. The fastest cyclist faced the eighth-fastest, the second-fastest faced the third, and so forth. Winners advanced to the finals while losers in each match received a final ranking based on their time in the round.

Unwound

Unwound was an American <a href="post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a> band, based in <a href="Tumwater">Tumwater</a>/<a href="Olympia%2C%20Washington">Olympia, Washington</a>, United States. Formed in 1991, the band consisted of <a href="Justin%20Trosper">Justin Trosper</a> (vocals, guitar, songwriting), <a href="Vern%20Rumsey">Vern Rumsey</a> (bass), and Brandt Sandeno (drums), all of whom had previously been in a band called Giant Henry. Brandt Sandeno quit Unwound in 1992 and was replaced by Sara Lund. This line-up would remain in place until the band's dissolution in 2002. The group was strongly associated with the label <a href="Kill%20Rock%20Stars">Kill Rock Stars</a> throughout the 1990s. Unwound was sharply dissonant and angular, often resorting to unusual guitar tones, and associated with <a href="post-hardcore">post-hardcore</a> and <a href="noise%20rock">noise rock</a>. The band toured frequently, preferring "all ages" clubs and are noted for their strong DIY ethic. The group spawned numerous side projects.
Unwound released a full demo tape in 1991, and recorded a mini-album in early 1992 (released as "<a href="Unwound%20%28album%29">Unwound</a>" in 1995). Two songs from the demo tape later appeared on "A Single History: 1991–1997". In July 1992 <a href="Sara%20Lund">Sara Lund</a> replaced her friend Sandeno. The band makes an appearance in the 1994 <a href="cult">cult</a> <a href="road%20movie">roadmovie</a> "<a href="Half-cocked%20%28film%29">Half-cocked</a>". The group released several singles and albums, primarily on the <a href="Kill%20Rock%20Stars">Kill Rock Stars</a> label, before disbanding on April 1, 2002, shortly after co-headlining that year's <a href="All%20Tomorrow%27s%20Parties%20%28music%20festival%29">All Tomorrow's Parties</a> festival. The fact that they broke up on April Fool's Day fueled speculation that they would, in actuality, remain together; an early band t-shirt had the inscription "Unwound 1991–2091". Unwound's "<a href="Fake%20Train">Fake Train</a>" was the first full-length musical release on Kill Rock Stars; it had been strictly a spoken-word label until its owner <a href="Slim%20Moon">Slim Moon</a> attended an Unwound concert and decided he had to release their upcoming debut (though technically second) album. Unwound also had the maiden releases for several other key underground record labels, including <a href="Gravity%20Records">Gravity Records</a> and Troubleman Unlimited Records; side project Replikants had the first release on <a href="5%20Rue%20Christine">5 Rue Christine</a>, an esoteric KRS offshoot. Rumsey founded and ran Punk In My Vitamins? Records, releasing material by Lowercase, Yind, the Bangs, <a href="Karp%20%28band%29">Karp</a>, Thrones, Dub Narcotic Sound System and <a href="Chokebore">Chokebore</a>. Trosper published several issues of his own underground rock fanzine in the early 1990s. Unwound and sonic/geographic contemporaries <a href="Sleater-Kinney">Sleater-Kinney</a> were generally considered KRS's flagship bands of the 1990s; no other band released anywhere near as much material on KRS as these two did. Although Unwound was not part of the <a href="riot%20grrrl">riot grrrl</a> movement, the band supported <a href="gender%20equality">gender equality</a>.
Troubleman Unlimited's Mike Simonetti after hearing of the band's breakup posted a quick eulogy to Unwound on his record label's Web site: "Unwound were (and still are) beautiful people. Unwound was one of the most influential and vital bands of the '90s, and their last record was a masterpiece. You just don't know it yet. Unwound's influence will live on for a long time to come, and they were everything a band should be: independent and non-compromising in every aspect."
After Unwound broke up Vern Rumsey formed Flora v. Fauna. Sara Lund formed Hungry Ghost with Andrew Price from the <a href="Irving%20Klaw%20Trio">Irving Klaw Trio</a> as well as joining <a href="Corin%20Tucker">The Corin Tucker Band</a>. In 2011, Brandt Sandeno and Justin Trosper formed <a href="Survival%20Knife%20%28band%29">Survival Knife (band)</a>. "Live Leaves", a live album documenting various performances of the band's final tour in 2001 was released later in the year. An Unwound online archive, curated by members of the band, was also launched in anticipation to the new release.
In 2013 Unwound licensed their back catalog to <a href="The%20Numero%20Group">The Numero Group</a>. They released their pre-Unwound band, Giant Henry, on <a href="Record%20Store%20Day">Record Store Day</a> in 2013 and the first of a series of box sets later that year.
Unwound's influences included <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href="Melvins">Melvins</a>, <a href="Fugazi">Fugazi</a>, <a href="Wipers">Wipers</a>, <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a>, <a href="Can%20%28band%29">Can</a>, <a href="Mission%20of%20Burma">Mission of Burma</a>, <a href="H%C3%BCsker%20D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a>, <a href="Nation%20of%20Ulysses">Nation of Ulysses</a>, <a href="Flipper%20%28band%29">Flipper</a>, and <a href="Gang%20of%20Four%20%28band%29">Gang of Four</a>. Evidence of the Black Flag influence can be seen in Trosper and Sandeno's side band with <a href="Tim%20Green">Tim Green</a> (of <a href="Nation%20of%20Ulysses">Nation of Ulysses</a>), The Young Ginns (named after Black Flag guitarist/songwriter Greg Ginn), and in their sample of Black Flag's lyric "I'm not a machine" in their song "Machine" (on Replikants' debut album). Trosper and Sandeno were also in a band called Worst Case Scenario that released an album on <a href="Vermiform%20Records">Vermiform Records</a>. Unwound's early work was characterized by intense vocals, jagged guitar lines, and more complex drumming than the band's peers. Trosper's lyrics were highly existential, cryptic, and generally bleak. From this angular, atonal starting point, the band developed their signature sound over the course of several albums and numerous singles. With 1996's "<a href="Repetition%20%28Unwound%20album%29">Repetition</a>", Unwound added synthesizers to the mix. Free-jazz style saxophone found its way onto 1998's "<a href="Challenge%20For%20A%20Civilized%20Society">Challenge For A Civilized Society</a>". The band recorded Peel sessions with <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> at the BBC in 1998; these were broadcast over the radio, and were released as the semi-official bootleg "<a href="Unwound%20-%20Live%20in%20London">Unwound - Live in London</a>" (on Love Letter). This new direction set a precedent that the band would follow for their remaining albums, culminating in the release of 2001's "<a href="Leaves%20Turn%20Inside%20You">Leaves Turn Inside You</a>", a double album the band recorded themselves over the course of two years. Unwound never covered any other artists' songs on their albums, though they did cover "Plight" by The <a href="Minutemen%20%28band%29">Minutemen</a> and Torch Song by the (pre <a href="Versus%20%28band%29">Versus</a>) band Flower on singles.
The band was known for its nonstop touring of the U.S. and Europe, and occasionally Japan. It shared stages over the years with the likes of the following, with earliest known date in parentheses: Sonic Youth ('95), <a href="Polvo">Polvo</a> ('95), <a href="Fugazi">Fugazi</a> ('95), <a href="Hovercraft%20%28band%29">Hovercraft</a> (European tour w/ them, '96), Lowercase, Polar Goldie Cats, <a href="Deerhoof">Deerhoof</a> ('98), <a href="Mogwai">Mogwai</a> ('99), <a href="Slug%20%28band%29">Slug (band)</a> (the band, not the rapper), <a href="The%20PeeChees">The PeeChees</a> ('98), <a href="Clikatat%20Ikatowi">Clikatat Ikatowi</a> (approx. '94), Chokebore, The Most Secret Method ('99), Yind ('99), <a href="Blonde%20Redhead">Blonde Redhead</a> ('95), <a href="Dub%20Narcotic%20Sound%20System">Dub Narcotic Sound System</a>, <a href="xbxrx">xbxrx</a> (who formed after attending an Unwound concert in Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1998) (2001), <a href="Bikini%20Kill">Bikini Kill</a>, and many more (members of Unwound and Yind occasionally performed live as "avant-Norge" "supergroup" Shag Bath). During their final (2001–02) tour, Unwound enlisted <a href="David%20Scott%20Stone">David Scott Stone</a> as an additional guitarist and original drummer Brandt Sandeno on keyboards, percussion and guitar.
The band was known for having an all-ages policy at almost every concert which it headlined. This meant that they would often choose to play at unconventional locations such as basements, Jaycee halls, and college auditoriums, rather than at the traditional 18+ or 21+ (alcohol-serving) music clubs. They did this because they frequented all-ages shows in Olympia as teens, so they wanted to let fans of any age attend their own gigs.
Trosper played several kinds of odd guitars, including the <a href="Univox%20Hi-Flier">Univox Hi-Flier</a> (made famous by Kurt Cobain), generally preferring guitars with <a href="P-90">P-90</a> pickups. He sometimes played a clear Lucite (<a href="Acrylic%20glass">Plexiglas</a>), Electra or Ventura, Japanese budget copy of the expensive originals designed by <a href="Dan%20Armstrong">Dan Armstrong</a> and produced by <a href="Ampeg">Ampeg</a>. He sometimes used an <a href="Echoplex">Echoplex</a> in the band's spacier ambient passages. Rumsey generally played a <a href="Fender%20Jazz%20Bass">Fender Jazz Bass</a>. He and Trosper often used <a href="Sunn">Sunn</a> and <a href="Kustom%20Amplification">Kustom</a> amplifiers, generally solid-state models; Trosper's main amp up to 1999 was a Sunn Concert Lead. Lund played a 1970's <a href="Ludwig%20drums">Ludwig</a> drum kit.
Members of Unwound participated in a number of projects that ran concurrent to Unwound, each self-styled as highly conceptual and distinct from the parent band.
Trosper and Sandeno, who have collaborated musically since the mid-'80s, helmed an experimental venture called Replikants (not to be confused with the band Replicants, which featured members of Failure and Tool). Early on, they each acted as multi-instrumentalists for the group. Inspired by John Cage, Can, and Miles Davis, they combined jazz, <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a>, tape loops, <a href="musique%20concr%C3%A8te">musique concrète</a> and vocal samples atop a <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a>-propelled base. Debut album "This Is Our Message" (1997) consisted of home recordings from 1994 to 1996 (the CD version contained ten bonus tracks not included on the vinyl version due to time constraints). <a href="William%20Goldsmith">William Goldsmith</a> of <a href="The%20Foo%20Fighters">The Foo Fighters</a> and <a href="Sunny%20Day%20Real%20Estate">Sunny Day Real Estate</a> played drums for a period in 1996 before they started playing with drummer <a href="Joe%20Plummer">Joe Plummer</a> of Bare Minimum/ <a href="The%20Black%20Heart%20Procession">The Black Heart Procession</a> and later of <a href="Modest%20Mouse">Modest Mouse</a> and <a href="The%20Shins">The Shins</a> and a rotating cast of members. With more of an electro-rock sound, their second and final album "Slickaphonics" was released on <a href="5RC">5RC</a> in 1999.. A West Coast tour ensued that summer and after it, Trosper shelved Replikants to focus his energy on finishing Unwound's next (final) album. Sandeno and Trosper also collaborated with video artist <a href="Slater%20Bradley">Slater Bradley</a> on a number of projects between 1999 and 2005 including a piece in the 2004 <a href="Whitney%20Biennial">Whitney Biennial</a>. They stopped performing as the Replikants in 2002.
Rumsey and friend Greg Allen recorded as enigmatic <a href="New%20Romantic">New Romantic</a>-styled pop band Long Hind Legs in the 1990s. Rumsey used the pseudonym "Wolfgang" and Allen used the alias "Paul", with only astute Unwound fans aware of their real identities. Following a slew of singles, their debut self-titled album came out in 1997 on Kill Rock Stars. The 12" EP "Open Wide" (+ remixes)/ "Alphabets Of Unreason" was released simultaneously. Atop peppy, carnival-esque backing music, "Alphabets Of Unreason" features the odd lyrics, "Atoms, boys' cars, dead-end fags/ God, his image, and <a href="Jerry%27s%20Kids">Jerry's Kids</a>/ Love-making noon orgies/ I want to kill, I want to kill.../ Pills, <a href="quinine">quinine</a> reveries... Scornful tramps, unwitting vamps, wasted xenophobes &amp; all the young zeroes/ I want to kill, I want to kill..." (note the first letter of each of the main words in the verses, then refer back to the song title). The "February 4–14, 1998" EP was released in 1998 on Kill Rock Stars.
Trosper and Sandeno also played together in two other bands, the Young Ginns, and Worst Case Scenario. The Young Ginns also featured Tim Green of <a href="The%20Nation%20Of%20Ulysses">The Nation Of Ulysses</a> on guitar (Justin played bass). The project was first conceived in 1991 when Brandt and Justin were stuck at Tim's house while on tour with Unwound. The band later became a reality when Green moved to Olympia. They released a 7" on Gravity Records in 1993. In 1998, all their recordings were compiled and released on CD by Honey Bear Records. After the Young Ginns, Sandeno and Trosper formed Worst Case Scenario. Worst Case Scenario released two 7"s, one on <a href="Troubleman%20Unlimited">Troubleman Unlimited</a> and the other on <a href="Lookout%21%20Records">Lookout! Records</a>, and an album on <a href="Vermiform%20Records">Vermiform Records</a>. Vermiform would release the group's entire discography on CD in 1997. Both the Young Ginns and Worst Case Scenario displayed a <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> sound. Trosper and Sandeno formed <a href="Survival%20Knife%20%28band%29">Survival Knife (band)</a> in 2011.
Justin Trosper also performed in Severed Lethargy (with members of <a href="Bikini%20Kill">Bikini Kill</a>) and Sara Lund and Vern Rumsey performed with the musical collective Witchypoo. Rumsey also played bass on <a href="Blonde%20Redhead">Blonde Redhead</a>'s "Fake Can Just Be As Good" album. In 2010, Lund became drummer of <a href="Corin%20Tucker%23The%20Corin%20Tucker%20Band">The Corin Tucker Band</a>, on which she works along the former Sleater-Kinney vocalist and guitarist, as well as with the Golden Bears' Seth Lorinczi.
"<a href="Fake%20Train">Fake Train</a>"'s cover art is simply a defiled copy of a <a href="Tom%20Jones%20%28singer%29">Tom Jones</a> LP cover which had been hanging over Trosper's doorway. The front cover to "<a href="New%20Plastic%20Ideas">New Plastic Ideas</a>" is literally just a blue and purple version of the cover to the <a href="Philippe%20Entremont">Philippe Entremont</a> record "Grieg: Concerto in A Minor for Piano and Orchestra". The cover and inner artwork of "<a href="The%20Future%20of%20What">The Future of What</a>" are illustrations by Russian <a href="constructivism%20%28art%29">constructivist</a> artist <a href="Yakov%20Chernikhov">Yakov Chernikhov</a> (1889–1951).

Geminga

Geminga is a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> approximately 250 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s (around 800 light years) from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a>.

The nature of Geminga was quite unknown for 20 years after its discovery by NASA's <a href="Second%20Small%20Astronomy%20Satellite">Second Small Astronomy Satellite</a> (SAS-2). Finally, in March 1991 the <a href="ROSAT">ROSAT</a> satellite detected a <a href="Frequency">periodicity</a> of 0.237 seconds in <a href="Soft%20X-ray%20emission%20spectroscopy">soft x-ray emission</a>. Thus, it is supposed that Geminga is a sort of neutron star: the decaying core of a massive star that exploded as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a> about 300,000 years ago.
It was once thought that this nearby explosion was responsible for the low density of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> in the immediate vicinity of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. This low-density area is known as the <a href="Local%20Bubble">Local Bubble</a>. Possible evidence for this includes findings by the <a href="Arecibo%20Observatory">Arecibo Observatory</a> that local micrometre-sized interstellar meteor particles appear to originate from its direction. More recently, however, it has been suggested that multiple supernovae in subgroup B1 of the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> moving group were more likely responsible, becoming a remnant <a href="supershell">supershell</a>.
Geminga was the first example of an unidentified <a href="Gamma-ray%20astronomy">gamma-ray source</a>, a source which could not be associated with any objects known at other wavelengths. It was first detected as a significant excess of gamma-rays over the expected background of diffuse Galactic emission, by the <a href="SAS-2">SAS-2</a> satellite (Fictel "et al." 1975) and subsequently by the <a href="COS-B">COS-B</a> satellite. The SAS-2 group 
reported a pulsation in the gamma-ray signal, with period approximately 59 s, although the limited number of detected gamma-rays (121 over a period of four months) led them to conclude that the pulsation was not statistically compelling. Due to the limited angular resolution of the instrument (approximately 2.5° at 100MeV) and the small number of gamma-rays detected, the exact location of the source was uncertain, constrained only to be within a relatively large "error region". At the time of detection, four weak radio sources were known within this region, two supernova remnants bordered it and a known satellite galaxy to the Milky Way lay nearby. None of these known sources were convincing associations to the gamma-ray source, and the SAS-2 team suggested that an undiscovered radio-pulsar was the most likely progenitor.
Despite the investment of a significant amount of observation time, the source remained unidentified through the COS-B era; their data did, however, rule out the claimed 59 s pulsation. Many claims were made about the source during this time, but its nature remained a mystery until the identification of a candidate source by the <a href="Einstein%20Observatory">Einstein x-ray satellite</a>, 1E 0630+178. The characteristics of the x-ray source were unique: large x-ray to optical luminosity, no radio emission detected by the sensitive <a href="Very%20Large%20Array">VLA</a> instrument, point-like emission in the Einstein imager and an estimated distance of approximately 100 pc, placing it within the Galaxy. An association between the gamma-ray and x-ray sources was not conclusively made until the <a href="ROSAT">ROSAT</a> x-ray imager detected a 237 ms pulsation, which was also seen in gamma-rays by the <a href="EGRET">EGRET</a> instrument and retrospectively in the COS-B and SAS-2 data. Geminga thus appeared to be the first example of a radio-quiet pulsar, and served as an illustration of the difficulty of associating gamma-ray emission with objects known at other wavelengths: some characteristic of the gamma-ray source, such as periodicity or variability, must be identified in candidate counterparts at other wavelengths in order to make the connection of their identity.
Finally, this principle held true when radio emissions of matching 237 ms periodicity were found at previously unsurveyed frequencies of 100 MHz and below.
The <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of Geminga is 178.2 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc%23Astronomy">mas</a>/year which corresponds to a projected velocity of 205 kilometers per second. This is very fast for a star, comparable to <a href="Barnard%27s%20star">Barnard's star</a>.
Geminga underwent a minor <a href="glitch%20%28astronomy%29">glitch</a> in the late part of 1996, with a fractional change in frequency of 6.2 × 10. A 1998 study of the pre-glitch ephemeris suggested that the timings were being affected by reflex motion due to the presence of a low-mass planet in a 5.1-year orbit, however this was later shown to be an artifact of <a href="signal%20noise">noise</a> that affects the pulse times from Geminga rather than a genuine orbital effect.

Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)

The Kingdom of Italy (; ) was a French <a href="client%20state">client state</a> founded in <a href="Northern%20Italy">Northern Italy</a> by <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I</a>, fully influenced by <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">revolutionary France</a>, that ended with his defeat and fall. It was governed throughout its existence by Napoleon's step-son, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a>, who served as <a href="Viceroy">Viceroy</a> for his step-father.
The Kingdom of Italy was born on March 17, 1805, when the <a href="Italian%20Republic%20%28Napoleonic%29">Italian Republic</a>, whose president was Napoleon Bonaparte, became the "Kingdom of Italy", with Napoleon I as <a href="King%20of%20Italy">King of Italy</a>, and the 24-year-old <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a> his <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>. Napoleon I was crowned at the <a href="Milan%20Cathedral">Duomo di Milano</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a> on May 26, with the <a href="Iron%20Crown%20of%20Lombardy">Iron Crown of Lombardy</a>. His title was "Emperor of the French and King of Italy" (), showing the importance of this Italian Kingdom for him.
Even though the republican Constitution was never formally abolished, a series of "Constitutional Statutes" completely altered it. The first one was proclaimed two days after the birth of the kingdom, on March 19, when the Consulta declared Napoleon as king and established that his sons would succeed him, even if the French and the Italian crowns had to be separated after the Emperor's death. The second one, dating from March 29, and regulated the regency, the Great Officials of the kingdom, and the oaths.
The most important was the third, proclaimed on June 5, being the real constitution of the kingdom: Napoleon was the head of State, and had the full powers of government; in his absence, he was represented by the Viceroy, Eugène de Beauharnais. The Consulta, Legislative Council, and Speakers, were all merged in a Council of State, whose opinions became only optional and not binding for the king.
The Legislative Body, the old parliament, remained in theory, but it never summoned after 1805; the <a href="Napoleonic%20Code">Napoleonic Code</a> was introduced.
The fourth Statute, decided on February 16, 1806, indicated Beauharnais as the heir to the throne.
The fifth and the sixth Statutes, on March 21, 1808, separated the Consulta from the Council of State, and renamed it the Senate, with the duty of informing the king about the wishes of the most important subjects.
The seventh Statute, on September 21, created a new nobility of dukes, counts and barons; the eighth and the ninth, on March 15, 1810, established the annuity for the members of the royal family. In 1812, a <a href="Court%20of%20Accounts">Court of Accounts</a> was added.
The government had seven ministers:
Originally, the Kingdom consisted of the territories of the Italian Republic: former <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Duchy of Milan</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Mantua">Duchy of Mantua</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Modena">Duchy of Modena</a>, the western part of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>, part of the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> in <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a>, and the province of <a href="Novara">Novara</a>.
After the defeat of the <a href="Third%20Coalition">Third Coalition</a> and the consequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29">Treaty of Pressburg</a>, on May 1, 1806, the Kingdom was given by Austria the eastern and remaining part of the Venetian territories, including <a href="Istria">Istria</a> and <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> down to <a href="Kotor">Kotor</a> (then called Cattaro), even if it had to give <a href="Province%20of%20Massa-Carrara">Massa and Carrara</a> to <a href="Elisa%20Bonaparte">Elisa Bonaparte</a>'s <a href="Principality%20of%20Lucca%20and%20Piombino">Principality of Lucca and Piombino</a>. The <a href="Duchy%20of%20Guastalla">Duchy of Guastalla</a> was annexed on May 24.
With the Convention of Fontainebleau with Austria of October 10, 1807, Italy ceded <a href="Monfalcone">Monfalcone</a> to Austria and gained <a href="Gradisca">Gradisca</a>, putting the new border on the <a href="Isonzo%20River">Isonzo River</a>.
The conquered <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Republic of Ragusa</a> was annexed in spring 1808 by general Marmont. That was the only time in modern history that Ragusa was united to Italy. On April 2, 1808, following the dissolution of the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>, the Kingdom annexed the present-day <a href="Marche">Marche</a>s. At its maximum extent, the Kingdom had 6,700,000 inhabitants and was composed by 2,155 communes.
The final arrangement arrived after the new defeat of Austria: Emperor Napoleon and King <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria</a> signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281810%29">Treaty of Paris</a> on February 28, 1810, deciding an exchange of territories involving Italy too.
On rewards in Germany, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> ceded southern <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tirol</a> to the Kingdom of Italy, which in its turn ceded Istria and Dalmatia (with Ragusa) to France, incorporating the Adriatic territories into newly created the French <a href="Illyrian%20Provinces">Illyrian Provinces</a>. Small changes to the borders between Italy and France in <a href="Garfagnana">Garfagnana</a> and <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a> came in act on August 5, 1811.
In practice, the Kingdom was a dependency of the French Empire.
The Kingdom served as a theater in Napoleon's operations against Austria during the wars of the various <a href="coalitions">coalitions</a>. Trading with the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was forbidden.
The kingdom was given a new national currency, replacing the local coins circulating in the country: the <a href="Italian%20lira">Italian lira</a>, of the same size, weight, and metal of the <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a>. Mintage being decided by Napoleon with an imperial decree on March 21, 1806, the production of the new coins began in 1807. The monetary unit was the <a href="silver">silver</a> lira, which was 5 <a href="gram">gram</a>s heavy. There were multiples of £2 (10 grams of silver) and £5 (25 grams of silver), and precious coins of £20 (6.45 grams of <a href="gold">gold</a>) and £40 (12.9 grams of gold). The lira was basically divided in 100 cents, and there were coins of 1 cent (2.1 grams of <a href="copper">copper</a>), 3 cents (6.3 grams of copper), and 10 cents (2 grams of poor silver), but following the tradition, there was a division in 20 <a href="shilling">soldi</a>, with coins of 1 soldo (10.5 grams of copper, in practice 5 cents), 5 soldi (1.25 grams of silver), 10 soldi (2.5 grams of silver), and 15 soldi (3.75 grams of silver).
The army of the kingdom, inserted into the "<a href="Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">Grande Armée</a>", took part in all of <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleon's campaigns</a>. 
In the course of its existence from 1805 to 1814 the "Kingdom of Italy" provided <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I</a> with roughly around 200,000 soldiers.
In 1805 Italian troops served on garrison duty along the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, during 1806-1807 they took part in the sieges of <a href="Siege%20of%20Kolberg%20%281807%29">Kolberg</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Danzig%20%281807%29">Danzig</a> and fought in <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. From 1808 to 1813 whole Italian divisions served in <a href="Peninsular%20War">Spain</a>, especially distinguishing themselves under <a href="Louis%20Gabriel%20Suchet">Suchet</a> at <a href="Siege%20of%20Tarragona%20%281811%29">Tarragona</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Saguntum%20%281811%29">Saguntum</a>.
In 1809, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène</a>'s "Army of Italy" formed the right wing of Napoleon I's invasion of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, winning a considerable victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Raab">Raab</a> and having a respectable share in the victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Wagram</a>.
In 1812, Eugène de Beauharnais marched 27,000 troops of the "Kingdom of Italy" into <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>. The Italian contingent distinguished themselves at <a href="Battle%20of%20Borodino">Borodino</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Maloyaroslavets">Maloyaroslavets</a>, receiving the recognition: 
Only 1,000-2,000 Italians survived the <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">Russian campaign</a>, but they returned with most of their banners secured. In 1813, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a> held out as long as possible against the onslaught of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrians</a> "(<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mincio%20River%20%281814%29">Battle of the Mincio</a>)" and was later forced to sign an armistice in February 1814.

The administrative system of the Kingdom was firstly drawn by a law on June 8, 1805. The state was divided, following the French system, in 14 "<a href="d%C3%A9partements">départements</a>", the twelve ones inherited from the republican era plus Adda (<a href="Province%20of%20Sondrio">Sondrio</a>) and Adige (<a href="Province%20of%20Verona">Verona</a>). The chief of the department, the <a href="prefect">prefect</a>, was the State's representative in each province, improved the administrative decisions of the central government, controlled the local authorities, led of the police and, differently from the republican era, had all the executive powers in its territory. The local legislative body was the <a href="General%20councils%20%28France%29">General Council</a>, composed by the representatives of the communes.
The departments were divided in districts, equivalent to the French "<a href="arrondissements">arrondissements</a>". The chief of the district was the vice-prefect, which had similar powers to the prefect, but over a smaller area. The local legislative body was the District Council, composed by eleven members. The districts were divided, as in France, in "<a href="Cantons%20of%20France">cantons</a>", seats of Tax collectors and <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">Justices of the peace</a>.
The cantons were divided in "<a href="Communes%20of%20Italy">communes</a>". The communes had a City Council ("Consiglio Comunale") of fifteen, thirty or forty members, chosen by the king or the prefect depending by the commune size. The Council elected two, four or six Elders for the ordinary administration, helped by a City Secretary. The chief of biggest communes was the royal "<a href="Podest%C3%A0">Podestà</a>", when in smaller communes there was a prefectoral <a href="Mayor">Mayor</a>. All the city offices were hold only by owners and traders, and the leadership of the owners was assured.
During the kingdom's life, the administrative system of the State changed for domestic and international reasons. Following the defeat of Austria and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Pressburg%20%281805%29">Treaty of Pressburg</a>, Napoleon annexed to Italy the territory of former <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>, as announced on March 30, 1806, and ratified on May 1. Seven new departments were created, six in the Venetian mainland, and one in Istria (<a href="Istria%20County">Capodistria</a>), whereas <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> received special institutions led by the General Provider Mr. Dandolo, and maintained its own laws. On July 14, 1807, the government passed a decree that reduced the number of the communes. Following the dissolution of the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>, the kingdom was extended along the Adriatic coast, and on April 20, 1808, three new departments were established. The final territorial change came in action on June 10, 1810, when, as announced by Napoleon on previous May 28, Italy lost Istria and the never fully incorporated Dalmatia, gaining as reward all the southern <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tirol</a> up to the city of <a href="Bolzano">Bolzano</a>, creating the 24th and last department: <a href="Department%20of%20Alto%20Adige">Haut Adige</a>.
The language used officially in the Kingdom of Italy was <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>. The French language was used for ceremonies and in all relationships with France.
The education system was implemented as universal for all children.
During the French rule of the area of Istria and Dalmatia the schools were in Italian, until they were part of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.
The Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay "The French school system in French Dalmatia" wrote that "Vincenzo Dandolo, the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa, an official from the local (Dalmatian) Education Department, published in May 1807 a plan for the Province's public education ("Il piano generale della pubblica istruzione in Dalmazia"), which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy...Instruction was to be in Italian".
During its last maximum extension (from 1809 to 1814), the Kingdom lost Istria/Dalmatia but got added Bolzano/Alto Adige and consisted of 24 departments.
When Napoleon abdicated to both the thrones of France and Italy on April 11, 1814, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a> was lined up the <a href="Mincio%20River">Mincio River</a> with his army against the German invasion, and he attempted to be crowned king. The Senate of the Kingdom was summoned on April 17, but the senators showed themselves undecided in that chaotic situation. When a second session of the assembly took place on April 20, the Milan insurrection foiled the Viceroy's plan. In the riots, finance minister Count <a href="Giuseppe%20Prina">Giuseppe Prina</a> was massacred by the crowd, and the Great Electors disbanded the Senate and called the Austrian forces to protect the city, while a "Provisional Regency Government" under the presidency of <a href="Carlo%20Verri">Carlo Verri</a> was appointed.
Eugène surrendered on April 23, and was exiled to <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> by the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrians</a>, who occupied Milan on April 28. On April 26, the Empire appointed <a href="Annibale%20Sommariva">Annibale Sommariva</a> as "Imperial Commissioner" of Lombardy, while many taxes were abolished or reduced by the Provisional Regency. Finally, on May 25, the Supreme Imperial Commissioner <a href="Count%20Heinrich%20von%20Bellegarde">Count Heinrich von Bellegarde</a> took all the powers in Lombardy, and former monarchies in <a href="Modena">Modena</a>, <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a> and <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> were gradually re-established; on May 30, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281814%29">Treaty of Paris</a> was signed, and the remains of the kingdom were annexed by the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, as announced by Count Bellegarde on June 12.

Andy Pandy

Andy Pandy is a British <a href="children%27s%20television%20series">children's television series</a> that premiered on <a href="BBC">BBC</a> TV in summer 1950. Originally live, a series of 13 filmed programmes was shown in 1970, when a new series was made. A third series was made in 2002. The show was the basis for a comic strip of the same name in the children's magazine "<a href="Robin%20%28magazine%29">Robin</a>".
The original version of "Andy Pandy" premiered on <a href="BBC">BBC</a> TV in 1950, on either 11 July or 20 June, as part of the "<a href="For%20the%20Children">For the Children</a>" strand (later "<a href="Watch%20with%20Mother">Watch with Mother</a>") narrated by <a href="Vera%20McKechnie">Vera McKechnie</a>. Initially the programmes were transmitted live, but it was realised that if the programmes were filmed, they could be repeated. Twenty-six episodes of fifteen minutes duration were filmed on 16mm, and were produced around 1952; they were repeated continuously until 1970. This version had narration by <a href="Maria%20Bird">Maria Bird</a>. In one episode Andy Pandy sees how high he can go on a <a href="Swing%20%28seat%29">swing</a>, an episode featured in the 1987 compilation by <a href="BBC%20Video">BBC Video</a>. Under the umbrella title "Watch With Mother" as well as the Andy Pandy episodes, there were also "The Woodentops", 'Bill and Ben', all having a similar format-filmed marionettes, there was also an animated drawn character called 'Busy Lizzy' incorporated into the "Picture book" series. All the filmed black and white 1950s original transmissions were narrated by <a href="Maria%20Bird">Maria Bird</a>, who was to become a co-producer, with Freda Lingstrom, who worked for the BBC. Bird was a prolific writer of books for the very young, notably Andy Pandy, but it was for her distinct 'BBC English' enunciation that she is best remembered.
A <a href="marionette">marionette</a> who lived in a <a href="picnic%20basket">picnic basket</a>, Andy was later joined by Teddy, a <a href="teddy%20bear">teddy bear</a>, and Looby Loo, a <a href="rag%20doll">rag doll</a>, who would appear when Andy and Teddy weren't around. Looby Loo had her own special song "Here we go Looby Loo". All three lived in the same <a href="picnic%20basket">picnic basket</a>. Each episode ended with a variation on the song: "Time to go home, Time to go home, Andy is waving goodbye."
It is claimed that the design for the character was based on <a href="Paul%20Atterbury">Paul Atterbury</a>, the then young son of puppeteer <a href="Audrey%20Atterbury">Audrey Atterbury</a>. A comic-strip version was published in "<a href="Robin%20%28magazine%29">The Robin</a>".

Another set of 52 episodes was made in 2002, using the <a href="stop-motion">stop-motion</a> technique instead of string puppeteering. The original nursery and garden were expanded to an entire village, with Andy, Teddy and Looby Loo now owning individual houses, and four new characters were introduced: Missy Hissy, a snake, Tiffo, a dog, Bilbo, a sailor, and Orbie, a yellow-and-blue ball. Whereas the emphasis of the original series was on music and movement, the emphasis of the 2002 series was on making and doing.

Jim Jefferies (footballer)

James "Jim" Jefferies (born 22 November 1950 in <a href="Musselburgh">Musselburgh</a>) is a Scottish <a href="association%20football">football</a> player and <a href="manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a>. Jefferies played for <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a> for almost his whole playing career and enjoyed a successful first managerial spell with the club, winning the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Scottish%20Cup">1998 Scottish Cup</a>. Jefferies has also managed <a href="Gala%20Fairydean%20F.C.">Gala Fairydean</a>, <a href="Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.">Berwick Rangers</a>, <a href="Falkirk%20F.C.">Falkirk</a>, <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>, <a href="Kilmarnock%20F.C.">Kilmarnock</a> and <a href="Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.">Dunfermline Athletic</a>.
Jefferies made more than 300 competitive appearances for <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a>. The main highlight of his playing career was playing in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Scottish%20Cup">1976 Scottish Cup Final</a>, which Hearts lost 3–1 to <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>. He also played in the famous 0-7 New Year Edinburgh Derby defeat against Hibernian. Jefferies eventually left Hearts in 1981, and spent the last two seasons of his career with <a href="Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.">Berwick Rangers</a>.
Jefferies left <a href="Berwick%20Rangers%20F.C.">Berwick</a> in 1983 to become a <a href="manager%20%28football%29">manager</a> at <a href="East%20of%20Scotland%20Football%20League">East of Scotland Football League</a> club <a href="Gala%20Fairydean%20F.C.">Gala Fairydean</a>.
Jefferies returned to the Wee Gers to begin his senior managerial career in September 1988. Despite a great deal of financial turmoil during that time, he turned the struggling team around to the extent that they set a club record of 21 games unbeaten in the league during season 1988–89.
In the 1990 close season Jefferies took over at <a href="Falkirk%20F.C.">Falkirk</a>, guiding them to the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">Scottish First Division</a> title (and promotion to the <a href="Scottish%20Premier%20Division">Scottish Premier Division</a>) in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20Scottish%20football">1991</a> and <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20Scottish%20football">1994</a>. Falkirk also won the <a href="Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup">Scottish Challenge Cup</a> in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Scottish%20Challenge%20Cup">1993</a>.
In August 1995, Jefferies returned to <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Hearts</a>. He was manager of the Hearts team that won the <a href="Scottish%20Cup">Scottish Cup</a> in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Scottish%20Cup">1998</a>, his greatest success in the game to date.
Jefferies moved south of the border on 20 November 2000 to replace <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a> as manager of then <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a>. He was given the task of selling players by chairman <a href="Geoffrey%20Richmond">Geoffrey Richmond</a> and was unable to prevent them from going down. He resigned in December 2001 after a poor start to the season left them with no hope of a promotion challenge. Former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> striker <a href="Stan%20Collymore">Stan Collymore</a> later described Jefferies as 'One of the most useless managers he worked under" on Talksport in January 2013. He criticised Jefferies training regime as "being from 1975".
On 28 February 2002, he returned to management back in his native Scotland with <a href="Kilmarnock%20F.C.">Kilmarnock</a>. He kept Kilmarnock in a respectable position despite the necessity of drastically reducing the club's wage bill, reaching the <a href="2007%20Scottish%20League%20Cup%20Final">2007 Scottish League Cup Final</a>. Following <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a>'s departure from Rangers at the end of the 2005–06 season, Jefferies was the longest-serving manager in the Scottish Premier League. He left Kilmarnock by "mutual consent" on 11 January 2010.
Jefferies was appointed manager of Hearts for a second time on 29 January 2010, just hours after <a href="Csaba%20L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20%28footballer%20born%201964%29">Csaba László</a> was sacked from the position. Hearts finished third in the SPL in the 2010–11 season, having threatened the dominance of the <a href="Old%20Firm">Old Firm</a> until falling away after February. Jefferies and right-hand man <a href="Billy%20Brown%20%28footballer%20born%201950%29">Billy Brown</a> were sacked by Hearts on 1 August 2011, after just two games of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Scottish%20Premier%20League">2011–12 Scottish Premier League</a> season.
Jefferies held talks with <a href="Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.">Dunfermline Athletic</a> about succeeding <a href="Jim%20McIntyre%20%28footballer%29">Jim McIntyre</a> as their manager and was appointed on 20 March. He was unable to keep the Pars in the top flight and were relegated at the end of the season. The following season in the <a href="Scottish%20First%20Division">Scottish First Division</a> the club ran into financial difficulties and were placed in <a href="administration%20%28British%20football%29">administration</a> in March 2013. This led to a 15-point deduction penalty by the <a href="Scottish%20Football%20League">Scottish Football League</a> as well as many first-team players leaving. The effect of the points penalty saw Jefferies' side relegated to the <a href="Scottish%20Second%20Division">Scottish Second Division</a> through the <a href="Scottish%20First%20Division">Scottish First Division</a> play-offs losing to <a href="Alloa%20Athletic%20F.C.">Alloa Athletic</a> in the two-legged final. Jefferies signed a new contract with Dunfermline in December 2013, after the club exited administration. He resigned as manager in December 2014 stating that he felt there was no other option than for him to leave the club. He also stated that <a href="Dunfermline%20Athletic%20F.C.">Dunfermline</a> was likely to be his last job in management. l

The consent procedure (formerly "assent procedure") is one of the <a href="Legislature%20of%20the%20European%20Union%23Special%20legislative%20procedures">special legislative procedures</a> of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>.
The assent procedure was introduced by the <a href="Single%20European%20Act">Single European Act</a>. Under this procedure, the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a> must obtain <a href="European%20Parliament">Parliament's</a> assent before certain decisions can be made. Acceptance ("assent") requires an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a> of <a href="vote">vote</a>s.
The European Parliament can accept or reject the proposal but not amend it. However, the Parliament can produce an interim report making recommendations for modifications, and a conciliation has also been introduced.
The areas included under the assent procedure were:
Following the adoption of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a>, <a href="International%20sanctions">sanctions</a> imposed on an EU <a href="Member%20State">Member State</a> for a serious and persistent breach of <a href="fundamental%20right">fundamental right</a>s requires Parliament's assent under Article 7 of the <a href="Maastricht%20Treaty">EU Treaty</a>.

Mitch Halpern

Mitchell Howard "Mitch" Halpern (July 14, 1967 – August 20, 2000) was an American <a href="boxing">boxing</a> <a href="referee%20%28boxing%29">referee</a> who officiated some of the sport's biggest matches. As a referee he was known for his decisiveness and integrity – for maintaining control in the ring while staying out of the way to let the spotlight be on the boxers.
Mitch Halpern began his career in March 1991 and went on to referee 87 championship fights and hundreds of non-title fights around the world. Mitch also volunteered for a foundation that grants wishes for children that are suffering with life threatening medical conditions. 
Halpern was trained and mentored by veteran boxing referee <a href="Richard%20Steele%20%28referee%29">Richard Steele</a>. "I taught him everything I knew," said Steele. "He took what I had taught him, and with his great natural ability, made himself a great referee." <a href="Marc%20Ratner">Marc Ratner</a>, who was the executive director of the <a href="Nevada%20State%20Athletic%20Commission">Nevada State Athletic Commission</a> during the time that Halpern was a referee commented, "There are certain officials in certain sports who are naturals...Mitch has a real feel for it."
Steele said that Halpern approached him one night after Steele had just finished refereeing a fight and told him that he wanted to be a referee. Steele recounted, "I have had numerous people come to me and say that. I always tell them, 'I will meet you at the gym Monday.' He was there Monday. Most other guys never show up. He worked hard. He worked harder than anyone I had ever seen. He wanted to be the best."
As part of the learning process to become a world-class boxing ref, Halpern asked Steele to get in the ring with him and box. They ended up boxing every day. Steele remembered, "He wanted to know how it felt to have a bloody nose and be hurt...He wanted to get the fullness out of being a boxer so he could make the right decisions...It really helped him to be the best referee of all time."
Halpern was assigned many of the highest-profile fights in Nevada. These included the first Mike Tyson–Evander Holyfield fight for the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">WBA</a> <a href="Heavyweight">Heavyweight</a> title at the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Garden">MGM Grand Garden</a> in 1996 in which Holyfield won by <a href="technical%20knockout">TKO</a> in the 11th round in a surprise upset. The fight was voted by "<a href="The%20Ring%20%28magazine%29">Ring magazine</a>" as both <a href="Fight%20of%20the%20Year">Fight of the Year</a> and <a href="Ring%20Magazine%20upsets%20of%20the%20year">Upset of the Year</a>. Others beside boxing insiders began to take note of Halpern during this fight. Marc Ratner recounted: "...Until Mitch got the first Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield fight, nobody knew how good he was."
Halpern was scheduled to referee Holyfield—Tyson II, what would come to be known as the infamous "<a href="The%20Bite%20Fight">Bite Fight</a>", but Tyson's co-manager, John Horne vehemently opposed. Officially, Tyson's camp did not cite any specific reason to The Nevada State Athletic Commission, only arguing that they wanted a fresh slate. Halpern commented at the time, "The day a fighter can dictate what happens in a fight, I'm gone, because then I don't have any authority anyway."
The NSAC stood firm with a 4—1 vote and were not willing to remove Halpern (whom one sports writer referred to as "the unwilling centerpiece of a manufactured controversy"). The day before the fight was to occur, Halpern voluntarily withdrew. In an interview with sports reporter Ron Futrell, Halpern explained his reasoning: "As an official, you don't ever want to be the center of attention, and that's what was happening. These are two great fighters, this is a big, big fight, and I didn't want to take away from that..." <a href="Mills%20Lane">Mills Lane</a> was subsequently chosen to be the referee. 
A little over 4 months later on November 08, 1997, Halpern refereed the rematch between Evander Holyfield and <a href="Michael%20Moorer">Michael Moorer</a> in which Moorer lost by TKO in the 8th Round. Holyfield retained his WBA, while gaining the <a href="International%20Boxing%20Federation">IBF</a> Heavyweight <a href="Championship%20belt">belt</a>.
Halpern refereed the match between <a href="Gabriel%20Ruelas">Gabriel Ruelas</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Garcia">Jimmy Garcia</a> for the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a> super <a href="featherweight">featherweight</a> title on May 6, 1995. Ruelas won the fight by TKO, but the match is mostly remembered because Garcia died in a hospital two weeks later from <a href="head%20injury">brain damage</a> sustained in the fight.
In a "New York Times" article, Ruelas explained that even when he was pounding Garcia with punches, Garcia maintained a composure to not act hurt, and the fight continued on for eleven rounds, with Garcia's father prodding him on in his corner. The doctor and Halpern inspected Garcia in the corner after the 10th round and found him coherent enough to continue, but the fight was stopped by Halpern in the next round. Although Garcia walked back to his corner, minutes later he collapsed and had to be taken from the ring on a stretcher. 
It is not clear what effect Garcia's death had upon Halpern. Physician-at-ringside, Edwin "Flip" Homansky, who often worked title matches that Halpern refereed, said "Mitch transcended the sport in that he truly cared about the fighters." Halpern's experience was similar to boxing referee <a href="Richard%20Green%20%28referee%29">Richard Green</a> — who officiated the WBA <a href="Lightweight">Lightweight</a> title match between <a href="Ray%20Mancini">Ray Mancini</a> and <a href="Duk%20Koo%20Kim">Duk Koo Kim</a> in 1982. Kim was knocked down in the 14th round but got up to beat the ten count. When Green spotted a worrisome dazed look in Kim's eyes, he stopped the match. Kim had sustained serious brain trauma and was carried out of the ring on a stretcher. He died four days later (Green died from a <a href="self-inflicted%20gunshot%20wound">self-inflicted gunshot wound</a> to the head about a year after the Mancini—Kim fight).
Halpern was the referee for several notable bouts in 1999: the <a href="Lennox%20Lewis">Lennox Lewis</a>—Evander Holyfield rematch at the <a href="Thomas%20%26amp%3B%20Mack%20Center">Thomas &amp; Mack Center</a> in which Lennox was the winner by <a href="unanimous%20decision">unanimous decision</a>; the <a href="Oscar%20De%20La%20Hoya">Oscar De La Hoya</a>-<a href="Felix%20Trinidad">Felix Trinidad</a> welterweight championship fight at <a href="Mandalay%20Bay">Mandalay Bay</a> in which Trinidad won by <a href="majority%20decision">majority decision</a> (billed as the <a href="Fight%20of%20the%20Millennium">Fight of the Millennium</a>, the fight set a pay-per-view record for a non-heavyweight fight); also in 1999, Halpern officiated the De La Hoya—<a href="Ike%20Quartey">Ike Quartey</a> fight in which De La Hoya won by <a href="split%20decision">split decision</a>. 
Halpern was also referee for the first of three meetings between <a href="Erik%20Morales">Erik Morales</a> and <a href="Marco%20Antonio%20Barrera">Marco Antonio Barrera</a>.
Halpern played a referee in the 1999 film, "Play it to the Bone".
Before his untimely death in 2000, Mitch Halpern was considered "a rising star" in the sport. Veteran boxing referee <a href="Joe%20Cortez">Joe Cortez</a> remarked that he considered Halpern one of boxing's top referees — which appeared to be a common sentiment in the industry. One boxing promoter commented that Halpern "never lost control in the ring". Achieving this requires that a referee maintain respect from the fighters and their corners, and is not swayed into not doing the right thing by politics or audience sentiment. It also involves intelligence to "read a fight" and understand the psychology of a fight's dynamics, which moves very quickly. Dr. Elias Ghanem, who was chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission when Halpern died, characterized him as "a real brave referee."
Halpern died on August 20, 2000 in his south <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was 33 years old. Detectives at the scene did not give details, except to say that there were two other people in the house at the time. Halpern had been engaged to be married when he died. He left behind his parents and a daughter from a previous marriage. Many boxing insiders upon hearing of Halpern's death expressed shock because Halpern had a reputation for being collected and not impulsive. For instance, boxing promoter and president of <a href="Top%20Rank">Top Rank</a>, <a href="Bob%20Arum">Bob Arum</a>, said that he was "flabbergasted": "I don't think he had an enemy. He was such a stable, rational personality — cool under pressure, unflappable; adding, "A lot of people, myself included, felt he was the best around. Nobody ever questioned his integrity." 
Halpern is interred at Pacific View Memorial Park in <a href="Corona%20del%20Mar%2C%20California">Corona del Mar</a>, <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a>, California.

Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks

The Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks were an <a href="American%20football">American football</a> team headquartered in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> that played for one season in 1991 in the <a href="World%20League%20of%20American%20Football">World League of American Football</a> (WLAF). The name was inspired by the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a>' flights on the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> of North Carolina. The three jet-trails and three planes in flight, as well as the triangle design in the logo, represented the three points of the Research Triangle area (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill). The team's cheerleaders were known as the "Kittyhawks."
The name was chosen by Raleigh citizens, the choices being the Skyhawks, Daredevils, or Rogues as published in the "<a href="News%20and%20Observer">News and Observer</a>".
The Skyhawks' home field was <a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20University">N.C. State's</a> <a href="Carter-Finley%20Stadium">Carter-Finley Stadium</a> in Raleigh. Then-<a href="New%20Orleans%20Hornets">Charlotte Hornets</a> owner <a href="George%20Shinn">George Shinn</a> owned the franchise, and the head coach was former <a href="NFL">NFL</a> player and N.C. State alumnus <a href="Roman%20Gabriel">Roman Gabriel</a>. 
The team had a 0–10 record in the 1991 season and averaged 12,066 spectators per game due in part by the lack of beer sales at Carter-Finley Stadium. The team folded after their lone season of 1991. To replace them for the 1992 season, the WLAF established a new franchise in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, naming it the <a href="Ohio%20Glory">Ohio Glory</a>.

Bhagavata

In <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> a Bhagavata (a "<a href="vrddhi">vrddhi</a>" formation from "<a href="Bhagavan">Bhagavan</a>", meaning "devotee of "Bhagavan"" , the Lord, i.e. God), is a devotee, worshipper or follower of "Bhagavan" namely God in His personal aspect. The form of worship is called "<a href="bhakti">bhakti</a>" which has the meaning of 'adoration'. "Bhagavat" or "Bhagavan" means 'the Adorable One', whereas "Bhagavata" indicates a worshiper of the Adorable One. It also refers to a tradition devoted to worship of <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>, later assimilated into the concept of <a href="Narayana">Narayana</a> where Krishna is conceived as "<a href="svayam%20bhagavan">svayam bhagavan</a>". According to some historical scholars, worship of Krishna emerged in the 1st century BC. However, <a href="Vaishnava">Vaishnava</a> traditionalists place it in the 4th century BC. Despite relative silence of the earlier <a href="Vedic%20period">Vedic</a> sources, the features of Bhagavatism and principles of monotheism of Bhagavata school unfolding described in the <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> as viewed as an example of the belief that Vasudeva-Krishna is not an <a href="avatar">avatar</a> of the Vedic <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, but is the Supreme.
In the ninth century <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a> "Bhagavatism" was already at least a millennium old and many disparate groups, all following the "<a href="Bhagavata%20Purana">Bhagavata Purana</a>" could be found. Various lineages of "<a href="Gopal%20%28Krishna%29">Gopala</a>" worshipers developed into identifiable denominations. However, the unity that exists among these groups in belief and practice has given rise to the general term "<a href="Krishnaism">Krishnaism</a>". Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well. Many places associated with "Krishna" such as "<a href="Vrindavan">Vrindavan</a>" attract millions of pilgrims each year who participate in religious festivals that recreate scenes from "Krishna's" life on Earth. Some believe that early Bhagavatism was enriched and transformed with powerful and popular Krishna tradition with a strong "human" element to it.
It is believed that Bhagavatas borrowed or shared the attribute or title <a href="Purusa">Purusa</a> of their monotheistic deity from the philosophy of <a href="Sankhya">Sankhya</a>. The philosophy was formulated by the end of the 4th century BC and as time went other names such as <a href="Narayana">Narayana</a> were applied to the main deity of Krishna-"Vāsudeva".
Some relate absorption by <a href="Vedic%20Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a> to be the characteristic of the second stage of the development of the Bhagavata tradition. Its believed that at this stage Krishna-"Vāsudeva" was identified with the deity of Vishnu, that according to some belonged to the pantheon of Brahmanism.
Rulers onwards from <a href="Chandragupta%20II">Chandragupta II</a>, Vikramaditya were known as parama Bhagavatas, or Bhagavata <a href="Vaishnavas">Vaishnavas</a>. The <a href="Bhagavata%20Purana">Bhagavata Purana</a> entails the fully developed tenets and philosophy of the Bhagavata cult whereis Krishna gets fused with <a href="Vasudeva">Vasudeva</a> and transcends Vedic <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> and cosmic <a href="Hari">Hari</a> to be turned into the ultimate object of <a href="bhakti">bhakti</a>.
References to "Vāsudeva" also occur in early Sanskrit literature. <a href="Aranyakas%23Taittiriya%20Aranyaka">Taittiriya Aranyaka</a> (X,i,6) identifies him with "Narayana" and "Vishnu". <a href="P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Pāṇini</a>, ca. 4th century BCE, in his <a href="Ashtadhyayi">Ashtadhyayi</a> explains the word "Vāsudevaka" as a "Bhakta" (devotee) of Vāsudeva. At some stage during the Vedic period, Vasudeva and Krishna became one deity or three distinct deities Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala and Narayana, all become identified with Vishnu. and by the time of composition of the redaction of <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> that survives till today.
A <a href="Gupta%20period">Gupta period</a> research makes a "clear mention of Vasudeva as the exclusive object of worship of a group of people", who are referred as <a href="bhagavatas">bhagavatas</a>.
According to an opinion of some scholars in Patanjali's time identification of Krishna with Vasudeva is an established fact as is surmised from a passage of the Mahabhasya – ("jaghana kamsam kila vasudevah"). This "supposed earliest phase is though to have been established from the sixth to the fifth centuries BCE at the time of Pāṇini, who in his Astadhyayi explained the word "vasudevaka" as a bhakta, devotee, of Vasudeva and its believed that Bhagavata religion with the worship od Vasudeva Krishna were at the root of the Vaishnavism in Indian history."
In the recent times this often refer to a particular sect of <a href="Vaishnavas">Vaishnavas</a> in West India, referring to themselves as 'Bhagavata-sampradaya'.
It is also a common greeting among the followers of <a href="Ramanujacharya">Ramanujacharya</a> and other yoga sects.
Constant Satsanga with devotees and Bhagavatas, repetition of His Name, Sri Ram, Sita Ram, Hari Om, etc., constant remembrance of the Lord, prayer, study of religious books such as the Ramayana, the Bhagavata, Hari Kirtan, service of ... It can also be spelled 'Bhagavats' and refer to a <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> concept.
Bhagavata Sampradaaya is a very old vedic tradition that respects all the darshana shastras &amp; siddantas. It is neutral to any particular practices like only Vaishnava, Smarta, Shakta, Gaanapatya, Saura etc., And instructs to practice the rituals that is in accordance with Vedas. Some of the practices of this Sampradaaya are continuous study of Vedas, all time chanting of Gayatri, Nitya Agni Upaasana, Atiti Satkaara, Vaishwadeva, Pancha Yagnas, Daana-Dharma, Simpleness, humbleness, socially accepted life style, Sachitdananda Dhyana, leaving egotism, Sarva samarpana Bhaava of ones own Sampat-Bhakti-Punya Karma-Knowledge. This is actual Bhagavata.

Cliff Hare

Clifford Leroy Hare was a member of <a href="Auburn%20University">Auburn University</a>’s first <a href="American%20football">football</a> team who went on to serve as chair of the Auburn Faculty Athletic Committee. Auburn’s football stadium, <a href="Jordan-Hare%20Stadium">Jordan-Hare Stadium</a>, is co-named for the longtime professor and dean of the School of Chemistry. He served as president of the <a href="Southern%20Conference">Southern Conference</a> before the formation of the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a>.
 Clifford Leroy Hare was born in 1869, in what is now known as the Oak Bowery Community just north of <a href="Opelika%2C%20Alabama">Opelika, Alabama</a>. In 1888, Hare began his one-half century relationship with Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API), which eventually became Auburn University.
Deeply involved in academics, athletics and policymaking at API, Cliff Hare’s biggest concern was for the development of the complete man. He strove to see that the young students who entered college there would have the opportunity to develop into well-rounded future citizens of Alabama. He often quoted Shakespeare in his chemistry classes, and he discussed philosophy with students and Auburn townspeople. His philosophy is summed up in an inscription on the Cliff Hare award, “Athletics make men strong, study makes men wise, and character makes men great.” This belief manifested itself in how he approached his personal life. He was involved in teaching, mentoring and enabling well-governed sports events at the university, as well as working to improve his community.
 Specific highlights of Dean Hare’s career at Auburn follow:
Cliff Hare served as part of the foundation of character-building forces of the school and the community of Auburn for nearly fifty years. In reality, his impact was felt throughout the southeast. In the 1934 API-Georgia football program, he is described as “one of the most beloved characters connected with athletics in the South.” 
Coach Jordan tells the following story, “Fessor Hare told me how he and Dr. Sanford - for whom the stadium in Athens is named - used to come to Auburn every year after the Auburn-Georgia game in Columbus to divide the money. They would sit down in the Hare kitchen, take the money out of an old cigar box, and spread it across a marble tabletop and say, ‘a dollar for you and a dollar for us’ until the game proceeds were divided equally between the two schools.”

The station lies some distance to the north-west of the High Street, on the edge of "Banstead Downs".
The station was opened by the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a>, as part of the Epsom Downs branch line, on 22 May 1865. The branch was originally laid as double track because of the race traffic, and was electrified on 17 June 1928. In the 1940s the station's name was painted in large letters on the roof, in order to help as a navigation tool for pilots coming into <a href="Croydon%20Airport">Croydon Airport</a>. Due to the destruction by fire of the Epsom Downs signal box in November 1981, the branch was singled for most of its length in October 1982, and trains stopping at Banstead now use only the Down platform, where there is a shelter, although the Up platform still exists.
The typical off-peak service from the station is one train an hour, to <a href="Victoria%20Station%20%28London%29">London Victoria</a>, and back again, via <a href="Sutton%20railway%20station%20%28London%29">Sutton</a>, <a href="West%20Croydon%20station">West Croydon</a> and <a href="Norbury%20railway%20station">Norbury</a>.

Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's individual pursuit

The women's <a href="Individual%20pursuit">Individual Pursuit</a> at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a> (<a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">Cycling</a>) was an event that consisted of matches between two cyclists. The riders would start at opposite ends of the track. They had 12 laps (3 kilometres) in which to catch the other cyclist. If neither was caught before one had gone 12 laps, the times for the distance were used to determine the victor. In the twelve matches of the 2004 event, one cyclist was lapped.
Ulmer held the world record coming into this event, which she set at the world championships in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in May 2004. She reduced the world record by more than 6 seconds during this event. All three of the medallists in Athens beat the previous world record.
WR denotes world record<br/>
Q denotes qualification for next round
The riders raced against each other in matches of two. Qualification for the next round was not based on who won those matches, however. The cyclists with the eight fastest times advanced, regardless of whether they won or lost their match. This resulted in the first two heats not having any riders advance while the next four heats each had both winners and losers advance.
In the first round of actual match competition, cyclists were seeded into matches based on their times from the qualifying round. The fastest cyclist faced the eighth-fastest, the second-fastest faced the third, and so forth. Winners advanced to the finals while losers in each match received a final ranking based on their time in the round.
In the women's individual pursuit finals, the current world champion and world record holder, Sarah Ulmer from New Zealand, set a new world record in the final for a time of 3:24.537 for the gold medal. It is the first time New Zealand has ever won a cycling gold medal. The Australian, Katie Mactier (3:27.650), set a very fast first 1000 m of 1:10.618, with a lead of one second, but Ulmer reversed this lead in the second 1000 m, and went on to win the pursuit by 3 seconds. Netherlands rider and former world champion, Leontien Ziljaard-van Moorsel rode a time of 3:27.037 for the bronze defeating Australian, Katherine Bates (3:31.715)

Dick Kulpa got his start in the cartooning business on Christmas Day in 1969 when his hometown Illinois weekly newspaper, the "<a href="Loves%20Park%20Post">Loves Park Post</a>", published his first cartoon strip, <a href="Double%20Eagle%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Double Eagle &amp; Co</a>. The semi-autobiographical cartoon told the story of a young man obsessed with his 1960 Chevy. The Double Eagle strip brought much attention to the young Kulpa, and he continued working as an independent editorial cartoonist and graphic artist. Several of his successful advertising campaigns earned awards.
Kulpa is also a former Alderman of <a href="Loves%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Loves Park, Illinois</a>. In 1977 he was elected to the <a href="Loves%20Park%20City%20Council">Loves Park City Council</a>. He would wear red, white and blue leotards and cape and become Alder-Man, crusader for justice, much to the delight of the townspeople. He served in this position until 1984, when he then became County-Man, (in maroon and gold tights) after an upset election to the <a href="Winnebago%20County%2C%20Illinois">Winnebago County</a> board. The elected official continued to pen issue-oriented editorial cartoons in office, sometimes commenting on other politicians.
Kulpa's first <a href="Print%20syndication">syndicated</a> work appeared in 1983, when he produced the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" and <a href="Bruce%20Lee">Bruce Lee</a> newspaper comics for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times%20Syndicate">Los Angeles Times Syndicate</a>.

Stink bomb

A stink bomb is a device designed to create an unpleasant <a href="odor">smell</a>. They range in effectiveness from simple <a href="practical%20joke">pranks</a> to military grade <a href="malodorant">malodorant</a>s or <a href="riot%20control">riot control</a> <a href="chemical%20agent">chemical agent</a>s.
The <a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20Records">Guinness Book of Records</a> lists two smelliest substances. One is "US Government Standard Bathroom Malodor"; a mixture of eight chemicals with a stench resembling human feces, only much stronger, designed to test the efficacy of <a href="deodorizer">deodorizer</a>s and <a href="air%20freshener">air freshener</a>s. Another one, "<a href="Who%20me%3F">Who me?</a>", is a mixture of five sulfur-containing chemicals and smells like rotting food and carcasses.
At one end of the spectrum, relatively harmless stink bombs consist of <a href="ammonium%20sulfide">ammonium sulfide</a>, which smells strongly of rotten <a href="Egg%20%28food%29">egg</a>s. When exposed to air, the ammonium sulfide reacts with moisture, <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolyzes</a>, and a mixture of <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> (rotten egg smell) and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> is released. Other popular substances on which to base stink bombs are <a href="thiol">thiol</a>s with lower molecular weight, e.g., <a href="methanethiol">methyl mercaptan</a> and <a href="ethanethiol">ethyl mercaptan</a>—the chemicals that give odor to <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s and are added in minute quantities to <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> in order to make gas leaks detectable by smell. A variation on this idea is the scent bomb, or perfume bomb, filled with an overpowering "cheap perfume" smell.
At the other end of the spectrum, the governments of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a> are developing stink bombs for use by their <a href="police">law enforcement agencies</a> and <a href="armed%20force">militaries</a> as <a href="riot%20control">riot control</a> and <a href="area%20denial%20weapons">area denial weapons</a>. Using stink bombs for these purposes have advantages over traditional <a href="riot%20control%20agent">riot control agent</a>s: unlike <a href="pepper%20spray">pepper spray</a> and <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a>, stink bombs are believed not to be dangerous, and they are effective at low concentrations.
Prank stink bombs and perfume bombs are usually sold as a 1- or 2-<a href="litre">ml</a> sealed glass <a href="ampoule">ampoule</a>, which can be broken by throwing against a hard surface or by crushing under one's shoe sole, thus releasing the odorous liquid contained therein. Another variety of prank stink bomb comprises two bags, one smaller and inside the other. The inner one contains a liquid and the outer one a powder. When the inner one is ruptured by squeezing it, the liquid reacts with the powder, producing hydrogen sulfide, which expands and bursts the outer bag, releasing an unpleasant odor.
Typically, lower molecular weight <a href="volatile%20organic%20compounds">volatile organic compounds</a> are used. Generally the higher molecular weight for a given class of compounds, the lower volatility and initial concentration but the longer persistence. Some chemicals (typically thiols) have a certain concentration threshold over which the smell is not perceived significantly stronger; therefore a lower-volatility compound is capable of providing comparable stench intensity to a higher-volatility compound, but for longer time. Another issue is the <a href="operating%20temperature">operating temperature</a>, on which the compound's volatility strongly depends. Care should be taken as some compounds are toxic either in higher concentration or after prolonged exposure in low concentration.
Some plants may be used as improvised stink bombs, One such plant is the <a href="Parkia%20speciosa">Parkia speciosa</a> or 'stinky bean', which grows in <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and Eastern <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The pods from this plant are collected when partly dried and stamped on, to release the stink.

These schools and photography centers offer a variety of alternative process workshops and classes.

Scott sled

A Scott Sled is a type of <a href="kite%20flying">kite</a> developed in the early 1960s by Frank Scott of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and based on an earlier design by William Allison, also based in Ohio. In 1964 it was featured in "Kite Tales", the newsletter of the American Kitefliers Association; as a result it became much more widely known. A large number of designs have appeared since then, the design described here is as it appeared in 1964.
Allison patented his kite in 1956; Scott never did. Allison won a civil cease and desist order against the Scott family after it had made and sold millions of kites.
The design is known for its ease of construction, sturdiness, light weight, portability, stability, and good performance. It is a sort of scoop-shaped parachute, held open by parallel <a href="spar%20%28aviation%29">spar</a>s. Most of the shape of the kite is produced by the pressure of the wind.
The cover is made of <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> sheet about thick. Three vertical spars are taped to the cover. These spars are wooden <a href="dowel">dowel</a>s 1/8 or 3/16 inch (3 to 5 mm) in diameter. A two-legged is used, one leg taped to each side of the cover. The length of this bridle is between long. Care is taken to make sure each leg is of the same length.
This kite type has continued to evolve, generally with only two spars. Vents are shaped differently, sometimes more vents or none at all. They are just called 'sled kites'.

Virginia Historical Society

The Virginia Historical Society (VHS), founded in 1831 as the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society and headquartered in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, is a major repository, research, and teaching center for <a href="History%20of%20Virginia">Virginia history</a>. It is a private, non-profit organization, supported almost entirely by private contributions. In 2004, it was designated the official state historical society of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
The Virginia Historical Society features award-winning exhibitions and programming that are entertaining and educational for visitors of all ages. One of the largest historical societies in the country, the VHS has more than of exhibition gallery space and the largest display of Virginia artifacts on permanent view. The VHS is the only museum with all of Virginia’s history under one roof — all centuries, all regions, and all topics are covered.
The mission of the Virginia Historical Society is to connect people to America’s past through the unparalleled story of Virginia. By collecting, preserving, and interpreting the Commonwealth’s history, the society links past with present and inspires future generations.
At its founding, the list of officers and standing committee members included the following: 
Standing Committee
In its early years, the VHS gathered an eclectic collection of natural history specimens, historical artifacts, and printed and written material. After the Civil War, the institution was renamed the Virginia Historical Society to reflect a primarily historical focus as it became more active in publishing historical material. The Society gained its first permanent headquarters building in Richmond in 1893. The Society's journal, the "Virginia Magazine of History and Biography", has published on a quarterly basis without interruption since 1893.
In the 1950s, increasing resources allowed the addition of a professional staff. Over the next several decades the society's collections grew. The publications program also increased as the VHS gained a significant role in the academic community.
In 1959, the society relocated from its headquarters in the Lee House on Franklin Street to Battle Abbey (constructed in 1912) on the Boulevard. To accommodate the society, a four-story wing was added to the west side of the previously expanded Battle Abbey. Since 1959, the VHS headquarters building has been renovated and expanded several times—including a new west wing to house the extensive society research library (1992); a north wing to expand its gallery space and house offices of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources (1998); a new south wing to add additional gallery space, storage, offices, and a nearly 500-seat auditorium (2006); and new spaces for public use on the north and south sides of the building (2015).
In 1992 the Society opened the Center for Virginia History, increasing its display and archival resources. Shortly thereafter, it entered into a partnership with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, an agency of the state government, which also had significant historical holdings (both artifacts and archives), forming a unique private-public partnership.
The VHS offers a wide array of educational programs, especially for students and teachers. These include outreach programs that take place in school classrooms, guided tours of exhibitions, and workshops and week-long summer institutes for teachers.
The VHS offers three members-only evening lectures and twelve to twenty noontime lectures every year that are open to the public. Audio and videos of past lectures are accessible on the web site.
The society's galleries are newly renovated and open Monday-Sunday from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
The Charles F. Bryan, Jr. wing, completed in 2006, houses the Reynolds Business History Center (RBHC). The RBHC seeks to acquire company records from important and representative businesses from around the commonwealth. In addition, the VHS has developed business history programs for scholars, businesspeople, students, and the general public.
Current exhibitions include:
<a href="http%3A//www.vahistorical.org/what-you-can-see/story-virginia">The Story of Virginia</a>, an exhibition that interprets 16,000 years of Virginia history from the earliest artifacts of Native Americans to Virginia at the beginning of the 21st century.
<a href="http%3A//www.vahistorical.org/what-you-can-see">Learn more about other exhibitions at the Virginia Historical Society</a>
Virginia House, situated on a hillside overlooking the historic James River in Richmond, Virginia, was constructed by <a href="Alexander%20W.%20Weddell">Alexander W. Weddell</a>, U.S. ambassador to Spain and Argentina, and his wife, Virginia Weddell, in 1928 from the materials of a sixteenth-century English manor house previously standing in <a href="Warwick">Warwick</a>. It was a blend of three romantic English Tudor designs, and, for its time, was a thoroughly modern home complete with seven full baths, central heat, modern kitchen, and commodious closets.
Now owned and operated by the Virginia Historical Society as a museum, the house has been preserved much as it was when the Weddells resided there.
The gardens and grounds of Virginia House provide a rich tapestry of texture and color throughout the year. Today, close to 1,000 types of ornamental plants thrive throughout formal and naturalistic gardens.

Fibrillin is secreted into the <a href="extracellular%20matrix">extracellular matrix</a> by <a href="fibroblasts">fibroblasts</a> and becomes incorporated into the insoluble microfibrils, which appear to provide a scaffold 
for deposition of <a href="elastin">elastin</a>.
Mutations in <a href="FBN1">FBN1</a> and <a href="FBN2">FBN2</a> are associated with .
<a href="FBN1">Fibrillin-1</a> is a major component of the <a href="microfibril">microfibril</a>s that form a sheath surrounding the amorphous <a href="elastin">elastin</a>. It is believed that the <a href="microfibril">microfibril</a>s are composed of end-to-end <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s of fibrillin. To date, 3 forms of fibrillin have been described. The fibrillin-1 protein was isolated by Engvall in 1986, and mutations in the FBN1 gene cause <a href="Marfan%20syndrome">Marfan syndrome</a>.
This protein is found in humans, and its genes are found on chromosome 15. At present more than 600 different mutations have been described.
There is no complete, high-resolution structure of fibrillin-1. Instead, short fragments have been produced recombinantly and their structures solved by X-ray crystallography or using NMR spectroscopy. A recent example is the structure of the fibrillin-1 hybrid2 domain, in context of its flanking calcium binding epidermal growth factor domains, which was determined using X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 Å. The microfibrils that are made up of fibrillin protein are responsible for different cell-matrix interactions in the human body.
Fibrillin-2 was isolated in 1994 by Zhang and is thought to play a role in early elastogenesis. Mutations in the fibrillin-2 gene have been linked to <a href="Beals%20syndrome">Beal's Syndrome</a>.
More recently, fibrillin-3 was described and is believed to be located mainly in the brain. Along with the brain, fibrillin-3 has been localized in the gonads and ovaries of field mice.
Fibrillin-4 was first discovered in zebrafish, and has a sequence similar to fibrillin-2.

European Political Cooperation

The European Political Cooperation (EPC) was introduced in 1970 and was the synonym for <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> foreign policy coordination until it was superseded by the <a href="Common%20Foreign%20and%20Security%20Policy">Common Foreign and Security Policy</a> in the <a href="Maastricht%20Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> (November 1993).
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the <a href="Member%20State%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EC member states</a> tried to give the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">internal market</a> a foreign policy dimension, but failed twice. The idea of the supranational <a href="European%20Defence%20Community">European Defence Community</a> of State and Government instructed their Foreign Ministers during The Hague summit (1969), to "study the best way of achieving progress in the matter of political unification, within the context of enlargement". The Foreign Ministers subsequently drafted the Luxembourg / <a href="Davignon%20report">Davignon report</a> (1970), which created an informal intergovernmental consultation mechanism where member states could achieve 'politics of scale' (Ginsberg 1989).
While EPC adopted the <a href="Intergovernmental%20organization">intergovernmental</a> nature of the <a href="Fouchet%20Plan">Fouchet Plan</a>s, it disregarded the 'French grandeur' of the <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> era. The involvement of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> guaranteed its <a href="Atlanticist">Atlanticist</a> nature. The <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> would furthermore be able to express its opinion, if matters within its competencies were concerned. Finally, the EPC did not have the strong <a href="Paris">Paris</a>-based <a href="wikt%3Asecretariat">Secretariat</a> of the Fouchet proposals. The <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> had always been anxious about this idea, as they thought that it might turn into a competitor for the European Commission. The EPC was amended and strengthened in the Copenhagen report (1973) and London report (1981). It was codified (formalized) with the <a href="Single%20European%20Act">Single European Act</a> (1986).
The EPC turned out a 'mixed success'. During the 1970s it was an active player in the Middle-East conflict and in the creation of the <a href="Conference%20on%20Security%20and%20Cooperation%20in%20Europe">Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe</a>, the predecessor of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a>.

Kennecott Utah Copper LLC (KUC), a division of <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto Group</a>, is a <a href="mining">mining</a>, <a href="smelting">smelting</a>, and <a href="refining">refining</a> company. Its corporate headquarters are located in <a href="South%20Jordan%2C%20Utah">South Jordan</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="United%20States">USA</a>. Kennecott operates the <a href="Bingham%20Canyon%20Mine">Bingham Canyon Mine</a>, one of the largest <a href="open-pit%20mining">open-pit</a> <a href="copper">copper</a> mines in the world in <a href="Bingham%20Canyon%20Mine">Bingham Canyon</a>, <a href="Salt%20Lake%20County%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake County</a>, Utah. The company was first formed in 1898 as the Boston Consolidated Mining Company. The current corporation was formed in 1989. The mine and associated smelter produce 1 percent of the world's copper.
Utah Copper Company had its start when <a href="Enos%20Austin%20Wall">Enos Austin Wall</a> realized the potential of <a href="copper">copper</a> deposits in Bingham Canyon, southwest of <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in 1887 and acquired claims to the land. Underground mining in the area was begun in 1890, and <a href="Daniel%20C.%20Jackling">Daniel C. Jackling</a> and <a href="Robert%20C.%20Gemmell">Robert C. Gemmell</a>, both engineers, examined Wall's properties and recommended <a href="open-pit%20mining">open-pit mining</a>. In 1898, <a href="Samuel%20Newhouse">Samuel Newhouse</a> and Thomas Weir formed the Boston Consolidated Mining Company.
Jackling and Wall formed the Utah Copper Company in 1903, and the company immediately started a pilot mill at <a href="Copperton%2C%20Utah">Copperton</a>. With financing from <a href="Guggenheim%20family">Guggenheim Exploration</a>, the first digging began in 1906. The same year, the <a href="Kennecott%2C%20Alaska">Kennecott Mines Company</a> was formed in Alaska, named after explorer and naturalist <a href="Robert%20Kennicott">Robert Kennicott</a>. A smelter was also started at <a href="Garfield%20County%2C%20Utah">Garfield</a> by the <a href="American%20Smelting%20and%20Refining%20Company">American Smelting and Refining Company</a> (ASARCO) to refine the Bingham ore.
In 1907, the Utah Copper mill in Magna started operation. Utah Copper and Boston Consolidated merged in 1910, and in 1915, Kennecott acquired 25 percent interest in the company. In 1915, to dilute the railroad's cost and find new ventures for the capital produced by the Alaskan mine, Kennecott Copper Corporation was incorporated out of the various financial interests involved. By this time, the Guggenheims were already actively working copper mines in Chile and Utah. Upon Kennecott's creation, they merged their Braden Copper Co. property in Chile, as well as 25 percent of the Utah Copper Co., into Kennecott. These moves gave Kennecott possession of Braden's El Teniente, the world's largest underground mine, in the Chilean Andes. The <a href="Bingham%20and%20Garfield%20Railway">Bingham and Garfield Railway</a> opened in 1911 to transport the ore, replacing the <a href="Denver%20and%20Rio%20Grande%20Railroad">Denver and Rio Grande Railroad</a>'s line. In 1936, Kennecott acquired all the assets of the Utah Copper Company.
In 1913, in response to labor strikes at Bingham and Tucker led by IWW organizers, Utah Copper hired armed guards led by Axel Steele. The Utah Copper guards protected strikebreakers from IWW violence, and forcefully ran 160 IWW organizers and supporters out of the small town of Tucker, Utah. Steele and some of his men broke up an IWW rally in Salt Lake City by assaulting the speaker on stage. 
During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Bingham set new world records for copper mining and produced about 30 percent of the copper used by the Allies. Many women worked in the mines, mills, and smelters.
On September 9, 1949 three company officers were killed in an airplane bombing known as the <a href="Albert%20Guay">Albert Guay Affair</a> in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>: the retiring president E.T. Stannard; his designated successor, Arthur D. Storke; and R.J. Parker, a vice-president. Charles Cox, formerly head of <a href="Carnegie-Illinois%20Steel">Carnegie-Illinois Steel</a>, was hired shortly after to fill the executive vacuum. The three men were passengers on flight on which Guay had shipped a timed-explosive device in the luggage of his then-wife, killing her and all others on the plane.
By 1961, Kennecott's copper mines included four large open pits in the <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>. As the mine in Utah expanded, it subsumed the land on which the town of Bingham was built, and the city ceased to exist in 1971.
In 1981, a world-wide fall in copper prices brought about the acquisition of Kennecott by <a href="Standard%20Oil%20of%20Ohio">Standard Oil of Ohio</a> (SOHIO). Production was interrupted from 1985 to 1987. In the latter year, <a href="BP">British Petroleum</a> acquired SOHIO, and Kennecott became part of BP Minerals America. In 1989 <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto Zinc</a> (RTZ) purchased mining assets from BP. Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation was formed by Rio Tinto in 1989 as a new mining company under the laws of the State of Utah.
Today, as the second-largest copper producer in the United States, Kennecott Utah Copper provides about 18-25 percent of the United States' copper needs. Kennecott’s Bingham Canyon Mine is one of the largest man-made excavations in the world. It is one of the top producing copper mines in the world with cumulative production at more than 19 million tons of copper. In 2011, Kennecott produced approximately 237,000 tons of copper, along with 379,000 troy ounces of gold, 3.2 million troy ounces of silver, about 30 million pounds of molybdenum, and about 1 million tons of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process. Since Rio Tinto purchased Kennecott Utah Copper in 1989 it has invested about $2 billion in the modernization of KUC’s operations. KUC has also spent more than $350 million on the cleanup of historic mining waste and $100 million on groundwater cleanup. Rio Tinto directly employs 2,000 people and contributes to more than 14,000 indirect Utah jobs.
KUC is considering alternatives that will keep the Bingham Canyon Mine open for additional decades. The open pit operations are currently projected to extend to 2016. The company proposes to expand the mine and reach an additional 700 million tons of ore resource by pushing back the south wall of the Bingham Canyon Mine 1,000 feet and deepening it 300 feet.
Rio Tinto Group, one of the world's largest mining operations, comprises <a href="dual-listed%20companies">dual-listed companies</a> Rio Tinto Limited (based in Melbourne) and Rio Tinto PLC (based in London). Although each company trades separately, the two Rio Tintos operate as one business.
Significant groundwater contamination exists in the aquifer downgradient of the Bingham Canyon mining operations. Approximately are impacted in the southwest portion of Salt Lake County. Because of the remediation efforts, which include more than a $100 million investment in a <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> facility, Kennecott's South End, (location of the contaminated aquifer) was removed from the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL). This investment represents one of many remediation projects along the <a href="Oquirrh%20Mountains">Oquirrh Mountains</a> to clean up historic mining sites. To date, Kennecott Utah Copper has remediated more than of the total impacted by mining at a cost of more than $450 million.
Another Rio Tinto-owned company manages the non-mining land and water assets previously owned by KUC, <a href="Kennecott%20Land">Kennecott Land Company</a>. Kennecott Land was established by Rio Tinto in April 2001 to develop surplus mining land. <a href="Daybreak%20Community">Daybreak Community</a>, the first part of the process, is situated on in the city of South Jordan where 20,000 homes and up to of commercial space are planned. Opened in 2009, Daybreak's first commercial center, <a href="http%3A//www.daybreakutah.com/shop-and-dine">SoDa Row</a>, contains a boutique, restaurants, hair salon and more.

Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's team pursuit

The men's <a href="team%20pursuit">team pursuit</a> event in <a href="cycling%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics">cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics</a> consisted of matches between two teams of four cyclists. The teams started at opposite ends of the track. They had 16 laps (4 kilometres) in which to catch the other cyclist. If neither was caught before one had gone 16 laps, the times for the distance (based on the third rider of the team to cross the line) were used to determine the victor.
The Australia-Great Britain rivalry continued in an event which saw a new world record.
For the qualifying round, teams did not face each other. Instead, they raced the 4000 metres by themselves. The top eight times qualified for the first competition round, with the other two teams receiving a rank based on their time in this round.
In the first round of match competition, teams were seeded into matches based on their times from the qualifying round. The fastest team faced the eighth-fastest, the second-fastest faced the third, and so forth. Winners advanced to the finals while losers in each match received a final ranking based on their time in the round.
Australia set a world record time in this match.
Teams were again re-seeded, this time based on their times in the match round. The third- and fourth-fastest teams faced off in the bronze medal match, while the fastest two teams competed for the gold and silver medals.
The final results are:

Nakayama Hakudō

, also known as Nakayama Hiromichi, was a <a href="Japanese%20martial%20artist">Japanese martial artist</a> and founder of the <a href="iaid%C5%8D">iaidō</a> style <a href="Mus%C5%8D%20Shinden-ry%C5%AB">Musō Shinden-ryū</a>. He is the only person to have received both "<a href="j%C5%ABdan">jūdan</a>" (10th degree) and "<a href="Hanshi%23Martial_arts_titles">hanshi</a>" (master instructor) ranks in <a href="kend%C5%8D">kendō</a>, <a href="iaid%C5%8D">iaidō</a>, and <a href="j%C5%8Dd%C5%8D">jōdō</a> from the All Japan Kendo Federation. In addition, he held an instructor's license in <a href="Shint%C5%8D%20Mus%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB">Shintō Musō-ryū</a> and a <a href="Menkyo%20kaiden">Menkyo kaiden</a> in <a href="Shind%C5%8D%20Munen-ry%C5%AB">Shindō Munen-ryū</a> making him the 7th "sōke" of that system. Nakayama was also one of the masters of the Shimomura-ha, which was called Musō Shinden Eishin-ryū, "<a href="iaijutsu">iaijutsu</a>".
Nakayama was born in 1872 in <a href="Kanazawa%20City">Kanazawa City</a>, <a href="Ishikawa%20Prefecture">Ishikawa Prefecture</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. He moved to <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> when he was 19 years old and entered the "<a href="d%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">dōjō</a>" of <a href="Negishi%20Shingor%C5%8D">Negishi Shingorō</a> of the <a href="Shind%C5%8D%20Munen-ry%C5%AB">Shindō Munen-ryū</a>. In time, Nakayama became a master of Shindō Munen-ryū "<a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a>". 
He taught at the Yushinkan Dojo, near <a href="Korakuen">Korakuen</a> in Tokyo, and he trained many of the top swordsmen of his day. He was a personal friend of <a href="aikido">aikido</a> founder <a href="Morihei%20Ueshiba">Morihei Ueshiba</a>, and he was instrumental in arranging the marriage between Nakakura Kiyoshi and Ueshiba's daughter, Matsuko. He also was the teacher of Ueshiba's student <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a>, developer of the <a href="Yoseikan">Yoseikan</a> dojo. Nakayama also taught kendo and Iaido to <a href="Gig%C5%8D%20Funakoshi">Gigō Funakoshi</a>, third son of <a href="Shotokan">Shotokan</a> karate founder <a href="Gichin%20Funakoshi">Gichin Funakoshi</a>, who gave his father´s karate a more Japanese flavour by adding kendo and Iaido based training exercises and technical improvements based on his swordsmanship training.
By the mid-1920s, Nakayama was one of the most famous swordsmen in Japan, and as such, he was made a leader of the committee that drew up the sword curriculum for the Toyama Military Academy. Therefore, he is considered by many to be the father of <a href="Toyama-ry%C5%AB">Toyama</a> swordsmanship. Nonetheless, Kimura Shoji wrote in 1926:
Nakayama was an active promoter of New Swords (e.g., modern swords made in the traditional fashion). Often, this involved cutting demonstrations. For example, on July 10, 1934, Nakayama publicly demonstrated the strength of New Swords by using one to cut an iron bar about the thickness of a man's finger. The bar had been wrapped in straw, and Nakayama cut it with a single stroke, without leaving a mark on either the table or the blade. The Japanese Sword Institute had forged the sword; the smiths were students of Kurishara Hikosaburo. Unfortunately, such high quality swords were too expensive for mass production. In 1941, New Swords typically cost ¥2,000-¥8,000 (US $1,000-$4,000).
At the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Nakayama was quick to advise Japanese people to greet Allied troops with grace, saying <a href="samurai">samurai</a> never mouthed what was finished. Said he:
Nakayama lived this advice himself, and as such, he was involved in the establishment of the postwar <a href="All%20Japan%20Kendo%20Federation">All Japan Kendo Federation</a>. 
Nakayama was also a poet and calligrapher. A sample scroll reads:

In 1986, Ward formed the band Grundig along with several other students; <a href="Sam%20McCandless">Sam McCandless</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Marshall">Jeremy Marshall</a>, and <a href="Matt%20Loughran">Matt Loughran</a> at Fletcher High School in <a href="Neptune%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Neptune Beach, Florida</a>. The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band released an 8-song EP called "Into Everything" and moved to <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Three and a half years later in 1995, Grundig broke up and Ward moved back to Jacksonville, where he, McCandless, <a href="Kelly%20Hayes%20%28musician%29">Kelly Hayes</a>, and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo.

Nanango

Nanango is a town in the <a href="South%20Burnett">South Burnett</a> region of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia. It is the fourth oldest town in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. At the <a href="Census%20in%20Australia%232006">2006 census</a>, Nanango had a population of 3,083. It is situated north-west of the state capital, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. Nanango sits at the junction of the <a href="D%27Aguilar%20Highway">D'Aguilar</a> and <a href="Burnett%20Highway">Burnett Highway</a>s.
The original inhabitants of the area were the <a href="indigenous%20Australians">indigenous people</a> belonging to the <a href="Wakka%20Wakka">Wakka Wakka</a> (or Waka Waka) people. The area was used as a gateway to the <a href="Araucaria%20bidwillii">bunya nut</a> festivals, where Aboriginal people would travel from far as far away as the <a href="Clarence%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Clarence River</a> in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and the Maranoa River to feast on bunya nuts from the <a href="Araucaria%20bidwillii">bunya trees</a>.
The area around Nanango was first settled by Europeans in 1847 by John Borthwick and William Oliver from <a href="Ipswich%2C%20Queensland">Ipswich</a> taking up pastures for sheep farming. Oliver selected an area of more than 500 km² that comprised four blocks – Coolabunia, <a href="Booie%2C%20Queensland">Booie</a>, Broadwater and Nanango.
The first commercial establishment at the present site of Nanango township was Goode's Inn, founded by prospector Jacob Goode. The inn served travellers journeying from <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> and Limestone (now known as Ipswich) and became the meeting place for early residents of Taromeo, Tarong and Nanango stations. The town of Nanango quickly developed around it. Goode's original rough slab structure met the licensing conditions as his first licence for the "Burnett Hotel situated at Barambah Creek" was given at a special licensing meeting on 26 April 1849.
Goode's Inn Post Office opened on 5 January 1852. It was renamed Burnett Inn by 1855 and Nanango on 1 July 1859.
The name Nanango has evolved from the Wakka Wakka word "Nunangi". There is dispute over the origins of the name Nanango- the word means "large watering hole" or but was also the name of a local aboriginal leader at the time of settlement. The original settlement was called "Noogoonida" by the aborigines, meaning "place where the waters gather together".
Beef, dairy and timber (in particular the valuable red cedar) were the primary early industries in the area. The discovery of gold at the Seven Mile Diggings near Nanango in 1867 precipitated a gold rush, and consequently a local population boom, however the gold deposits were found to be meagre. At one time the population included 700 miners, many of whom were Chinese. A second population boom occurred when the Brisbane Valley railway line was extended to <a href="Yarraman%2C%20Queensland">Yarraman</a> in 1911. Nanango became the terminus of a branch off the South Burnett railway line at <a href="Kingaroy%2C%20Queensland">Kingaroy</a> on 13 November 1911. The (14-mile) missing rail link between Nanango and Yarraman, although planned was never built.
On 29 January 1920, the Nanango War Memorial was unveiled by the Major-General <a href="Thomas%20William%20Glasgow">Thomas William Glasgow</a>.
After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, however, growth levelled off until the early 1970s when the development of the Tarong Power Station led to a third population explosion. <a href="McCauley%20Weir">McCauley Weir</a> was used as the town's water supply until three additional <a href="Water%20well">bores</a> were drilled at the confluence of Barkers Creek and Meandu Creek.
Nanango has a number of <a href="heritage-listed">heritage-listed</a> sites, including:
Ringsfield House: 41-41 Albert Street, Nanango. Built by Robin Dods for Mrs Florence Graham in 1908. Grand country residence and gardens.
The area has a similar climate to nearby <a href="Kingaroy">Kingaroy</a>, however it is described as cooler in winter and more humid.
Nanango's principal industries are <a href="power%20station">power generation</a> and coal mining, agriculture, beef and pork production, <a href="dairying">dairying</a> and milk processing, timber growing and milling, small crops, <a href="natural%20medicine">natural medicine</a>, art and craftwork and tourism. 
Nanango has two primary schools being Nanango State Primary situated near Barkers creek and a Catholic school called St. Patricks. It also has the Nanango State High School which was established in 1982,and is set over 35 <a href="acres">acres</a> of land. The State High School, which has over 500 students and a special education unit (SEU), was previously situated on the same land as Nanango State Primary School.
Nanango also has a vigorous cultural and sporting life and is host to several potteries, Art Gallery and many craft outlets. The town also has many clubs and a range of sporting facilities including an <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">RSL</a>, <a href="cycling">bike</a>, <a href="darts">darts</a>, golf, <a href="lawn%20bowling">lawn bowling</a> and <a href="archery">archery</a> clubs. There are 13 well-maintained parklands in the <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Australia">Shire</a> which naturalists believe are home to 250 different bird species.
The South Burnett Regional Council operates a library in Nanango. It hosts events for children.
Located approximately away from <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Nanango attracts day and weekend trippers from <a href="South%20East%20Queensland">South East Queensland</a>. Tourists also travel through the town on their way between <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton</a> in the north and Sydney/<a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in the south. The CBD features chainsaw sculptures and murals which reflect the town's historical connections with timber-felling, farming and mining.
A great deal of Nanango's colourful history is preserved in its buildings – especially Ringsfield House, a restored circa 1908 <a href="Queenslander%20%28architecture%29">Queenslander</a> developed by architect <a href="Robin%20Dods">Robin Dods</a> and now the headquarters of the Nanango Historical Society. Unfortunately a number of fires throughout history have ravaged the CBD of the town, especially the fire of 1940 which destroyed all of the shops on the southern side of Drayton Street from Fitzroy to Henry Street. This has led the CBD to have a "1950s feel" due to the architecture of the time. One building that escaped the ravages of fire was "Nobby's Corner", an example of an old-fashioned corner store with wide verandahs.
Nanango serves as a gateway for exploration of nearby towns. <a href="Day%20trip">Day trip</a>s from the town include the Grapes and Gourmets Drive, <a href="Bunya%20Mountains">Bunya Mountains</a>, Coomba Falls and fossicking at Seven Mile Diggings. The "Great Bunya Drive" was created in 2006 and passes through the township and other regional attractions.
The Nanango Country Markets are featured on the 1st Saturday of every month and are widely recognised as the largest rural markets in SE Queensland. They have on average over 400 stalls, and reportedly in December 2013 had over 800 stalls.
Nanango has a range of accommodation for tourists, including caravan parks and motels.
Nanango has a number of live entertainment venues which regularly host performances by local theatre and musical groups. The Lee Park race track – not far south of the CBD – hosts around 8 meetings each year.
Major annual events include the international Criterium Bike Race (held in Nanango's CBD in February); the Nanango Show (held at the Nanango Showgrounds in April); Nanango Medieval Fest (fourth Saturday in August); Nanango Arts Fest (held over a week in October); the Nanango Country Music Muster (held at the Showgrounds in September); the week-long Mardi Gras (in October), and the Christmas Carnival (in December).

Interstate Commerce Commission v. Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific Railway Co.

Interstate Commerce Commission v. <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20New%20Orleans%2C%20and%20Texas%20Pacific%20Railway">Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway Co.</a>, <a href="Case%20citation">167 U.S. 479</a> (1897), was an important early <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> case in the development of <a href="American%20administrative%20law">American administrative law</a>.
The power of an administrative agency is <a href="executive%20%28government%29">executive</a> and <a href="Public%20administration">administrative</a>, but not <a href="legislative">legislative</a>. The scope of authority held by an agency is determined by the agency's <a href="organic%20statute%20%28USA%29">organic statute</a>. Where an administrative agency wishes to assume the traditionally legislative power to make policy, the power must be expressly granted by the agency's organic statute, and not implied from other terms of the statute. This principle applies especially where the policy involves issues of great consequence.
Note: This principle was later qualified by cases such as "<a href="NBC%20v.%20US">NBC v. US</a>" which provided for more expansive powers for administrative agencies.
The <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">ICC</a> set rates for rail transport, and issued an order requiring all rail companies who charged more than the set rates to cease operations. The ICC then went to the <a href="6th%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">6th Circuit Court of Appeals</a> to seek a legal injunction requiring the <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Texas%20Pacific%20Railway">Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway</a> to comply with the order. The 6th circuit sent a certified question to the US Supreme Court, asking:
Ultimately, the Supreme Court determined that the ICC had no such power.
The ICC's authority stemmed from the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Act">Interstate Commerce Act</a>, the <a href="organic%20statute">organic statute</a> which gave the ICC life, and determined the extent of its powers. The Court considered two possible ways that Congress might vest the power to set rates in the ICC: expressly in the statute, or implied from the terms of the statute.
The Court found first that nowhere in the statute is the ICC expressly given power to set rates.
The issue of implied power also required consideration. The ICC asserted that the power should be implied from the first section, which provided that "all charges ... should be reasonable and just; and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such serve is prohibited and declared to be unlawful." The ICC deduced that if all charges must be reasonable, and Congress had not determined what was reasonable, then the ICC must determine which rates are reasonable, in order to perform its legal obligation to ensure that all rates would be reasonable and just. Therefore, they argued, the only reasonable interpretation of the statute was that Congress intended them to exercise the power to set rates.
The Court rejected this argument, holding that the powers granted by the terms of the statute were solely executive and administrative, but not legislative. As such, without an explicit grant of the power to set rates by Congress, the ICC was not permitted to set rates for rail transport.

Pelletron

A pelletron is a type of <a href="Electrostatic%20generator">electrostatic</a> <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> similar to a <a href="Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator">Van de Graaff generator</a>. Pelletrons have been built in many sizes, from small units producing voltages up to 500 kilovolts (kV) and beam energies up to 1 <a href="Electronvolt">megaelectronvolt</a> (MeV) of kinetic energy, to the largest system, which has reached a DC voltage of over 25 megavolts and produced <a href="ion%20beam">ion beam</a>s with energies over 900 MeV. Generating electric charge is done by a mechanical transportation system made of a chain of pellets (short conductive tubes connected by links made of insulating material), that is used to build up high voltages on the Pelletron terminal. The system is enclosed by a pressure vessel filled with <a href="insulating%20gas">insulating gas</a>, such as SF (<a href="sulfur%20hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a>), and an evacuated <a href="beamline">beamline</a>. The <a href="potential%20difference">potential difference</a> between the terminal and <a href="Ground_%28electricity%29">ground</a> is used to accelerate several kinds of particles, such as <a href="positron">positron</a>s, <a href="electron">electron</a>s and negative and positive <a href="ion">ion</a>s. 
Compared to the Van de Graaff generator, the pellet chain can operate at a higher velocity than a <a href="rubber">rubber</a> belt, and both the voltage and currents that can be attained are far higher. The chain is charged more uniformly than the belt of a Van de Graaff, so the stability of the terminal voltage and the particle energy is also higher.
Pelletron accelerators are used as analytical tools in many fields, including materials analysis, <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> development and production, pharmaceutical research, and as ultra-sensitive <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a>s for <a href="carbon%20dating">carbon dating</a> and the measurement of other rare <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s.

Stephen Lynch (musician)

Stephen Andrew Lynch (born July 28, 1971), is an American comedian, musician and <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>-nominated actor who is known for his songs mocking daily life and popular culture. Lynch has released three studio albums and three live albums along with a live DVD. He has appeared in two "<a href="Comedy%20Central%20Presents">Comedy Central Presents</a>" specials and starred in the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> adaptation of "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Singer%20%28musical%29">The Wedding Singer</a>". Stephen released a new double-disc (Studio &amp; Live) album, "<a href="Lion%20%28Stephen%20Lynch%20album%29">Lion</a>", on November 13, 2012.
Lynch was born in <a href="Abington%20Township%2C%20Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Abington, Pennsylvania</a>. His family later moved to <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>, Michigan. Lynch would perform in <a href="community%20theatre">community theatre</a> and musical theatre while attending Arthur Hill High School and The Center for Arts and Sciences. He received a theater scholarship to attend <a href="The%20Catholic%20University%20of%20America">The Catholic University of America</a> in Washington, D.C. before transferring in 1990 to <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan University</a> where he graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">BA</a> in drama in 1993. At <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan University</a>, he began to write comedic songs.
Considering himself a musician first and a comedian second, Lynch cites singer/songwriters <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a> and <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> as his childhood inspirations, rather than comics. He was inspired to go into show business after seeing the <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> "<a href="This%20is%20Spinal%20Tap">This is Spinal Tap</a>". The first song that he wrote was a <a href="country%20music">country</a> song titled "Beefy Burrito." 
After spending his first year out of college with friends in California, Lynch moved to New York City in 1996 with the intention of becoming an actor. Upon his arrival, a friend at the <a href="Laurie%20Beechman%20Theatre">West Bank Cafe</a> on 42nd Street suggested Lynch play, for an audience, some of the comic songs he had written while attending university. He soon found success in comedy clubs and other venues around the city (notably <a href="Catch%20a%20Rising%20Star%20%28comedy%20clubs%29">Catch a Rising Star</a> and <a href="Caroline%27s">Caroline's</a>), and became a regular on radio shows such as "<a href="Opie%20and%20Anthony">Opie and Anthony</a>". Lynch spent his early years in New York City doing what he called "totally mindless work" as a temp worker. He quit such temporary jobs permanently, signing with <a href="What%20Are%20Records%3F">What Are Records?</a> in 2000 and Vision International in 2002.
Over the next few years, he toured colleges, universities and <a href="nightclubs">nightclubs</a> around the country, avoiding as much as possible the <a href="comedy%20club">comedy club</a> circuit, which he has stated is not to his taste. He periodically returned to Michigan to do <a href="summer%20stock">summer stock</a>. During his March 6, 2009 appearance on "<a href="The%20Bob%20and%20Tom%20Show">The Bob and Tom Show</a>", Lynch mentioned "Steel Toast" as the name of the band in which he first performed. As of the start of his 3 Balloons tour in Spring 2009, <a href="Agency%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Agency for the Performing Arts</a> books all of his concert dates.
As a result of the duality of his act, Lynch turned heads in the music industry as well as on the comedy circuit. He attracted extra attention usually not available to comics by playing venues more often suited to music than to comedy (eventually graduating to locations such as the <a href="House%20of%20Blues">House of Blues</a>, <a href="The%20Town%20Hall">The Town Hall</a> and the esteemed <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>). He gained great national exposure with his "<a href="Comedy%20Central%20Presents">Comedy Central Presents</a>" special in 2000, one of the highest rated in the network's history. He has made appearances on "<a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>"'s "<a href="Premium%20Blend">Premium Blend</a>", "The World Comedy Tour" and "The World Stands Up". He has also made four appearances on "<a href="Last%20Call%20with%20Carson%20Daly">Last Call with Carson Daly</a>", and has performed at the prestigious "<a href="Just%20for%20Laughs">Just for Laughs</a>" Comedy Festival in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Canada.
Lynch has opened for comedians <a href="Jay%20Mohr">Jay Mohr</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Foxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a>, <a href="Steven%20Wright">Steven Wright</a>, <a href="Bobcat%20Goldthwait">Bobcat Goldthwait</a> and <a href="Lewis%20Black">Lewis Black</a>. In the summer of 2004, he went on a tour co-headlining with <a href="Mitch%20Hedberg">Mitch Hedberg</a>. The tour was such a success that they added an extra leg and ran into 2005. This was Hedberg's last tour before his death.
He has also appeared in five short films, including "The Love Seat" in 1999 and "The Confetti Brothers" in 2001. Both films were written and directed by Kirker Butler. "The Confetti Brothers", a satire, screened to packed houses at the 2001 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. It continues to play the film festival circuit.
In April 2006, Lynch starred as Robbie Hart in the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Singer%20%28musical%29">The Wedding Singer</a>", which ran on Broadway from April 27, 2006 through December 31, 2006 at the <a href="Al%20Hirschfeld%20Theatre">Al Hirschfeld Theatre</a>. This musical production was based on the 1998 <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> film "<a href="The%20Wedding%20Singer">The Wedding Singer</a>" starring <a href="Adam%20Sandler">Adam Sandler</a> and <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>. The musical, Lynch's Broadway debut, co-starred <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony</a> winner <a href="Laura%20Benanti">Laura Benanti</a> in the role of Julia Sullivan, played by Barrymore in the film. The April 2006 opening followed a successful preview run in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> at <a href="5th%20Avenue%20Theatre">The 5th Avenue Theatre</a> which ran from January 31 through February 19. His performance has earned him nominations for <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony</a>, <a href="Drama%20League%20Award">Drama League</a> and <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk</a> awards, According to interviews after, he stated that, due to the rehearsals for the show, he had forgotten most of his own songs.
In 2007, Lynch returned to the road again, touring with comedians such as <a href="Bob%20Saget">Bob Saget</a>, <a href="Frank%20Caliendo">Frank Caliendo</a>, <a href="Louis%20C.K.">Louis C.K.</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Mencia">Carlos Mencia</a> and others on the <a href="Opie%20and%20Anthony%27s%20Traveling%20Virus%20Comedy%20Tour">Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus Comedy Tour</a> during <a href="Opie%20and%20Anthony%27s%20Traveling%20Virus%20Comedy%20Tour%20%282007%29">2007</a>.
Lynch starred in his second "<a href="Comedy%20Central%20Presents">Comedy Central Presents</a>" special in January 2008.
Lynch performed on his first European tours in 2008, headlining concerts in England, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, Ireland, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and Germany. All but two of the seventeen shows sold out, despite never playing a majority of the markets. Lynch attributes this success to YouTube.
His newfound European popularity resulted in appearances at six festivals in August and September 2008. He played in the UK at the <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading and Leeds Festivals</a>, headlining the Alternative stage at each site. He also appeared at the <a href="Lowlands%20Festival">Lowlands Festival</a> in the Netherlands on August 17, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> Edge Festival (during <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival%20Fringe">Fringe</a>) on August 24, The Pimm's Summerfest in <a href="Holland%20Park">Holland Park</a>, London on August 28, and Bulmer's Comedy Festival in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> at the Olympia Theater on September 1 and 2. He returned to Europe in Fall, 2009 and toured the UK in March 2010, headlining London's <a href="Brixton%20Academy">Brixton Academy</a> on March 5, 2010. Lynch's second studio album, "<a href="3%20Balloons">3 Balloons</a>", was released on March 10, 2009.
In June 2011, among other venues, Lynch performed at Kulturens Hus in <a href="Lule%C3%A5">Luleå</a>, Sweden.
On March 6, 2011, while replying to a message on Twitter, Lynch announced that he was working on a new CD. When asked if it would be studio or live, he replied "I'm leaning studio." "<a href="Lion%20%28Stephen%20Lynch%20album%29">Lion</a>", a double live/studio album, was released on November 13, 2012 to solid reviews.
He married Erin Dwight on a private beach on <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> in September 2003, and she is generally the first person to hear his original ideas for songs. Her effect upon his material is such that if she does not laugh at the initial concept, he will scrap the idea completely. Dwight recorded a short film while her husband was away touring, called "Lynch and Teich in Brooklyn", to show that she missed him. This was included in the extras on his 2004 concert DVD, "<a href="Live%20at%20the%20El%20Rey%20%28DVD%29">Live at the El Rey</a>". She also co-created the cover concept for the album, "<a href="The%20Craig%20Machine">The Craig Machine</a>", with her mother, <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> photographer Fran Dwight.
Lynch has a younger brother, Drew. Lynch and his brother occasionally tour together. Their parents are a former priest and a former <a href="nun">nun</a>. Both parents became teachers. Lynch has stated that religion was not forced upon him growing up, and, although he was raised <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, he no longer attends church. His upbringing included liberalism as well as religion, which is reflected through his father's past as part of a singing duo that attended many peace rallies and antiwar protests during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Like his sons, Lynch's father was a stage actor as well as a singer, and musical talent and interest runs in their family. Lynch's earliest work in the theater was performing with his father in local community theater productions in Saginaw as a child. The first live musical he saw was "<a href="Man%20of%20La%20Mancha">Man of La Mancha</a>", a community theater production in which his father played the role of the Padre.
As Lynch's repertoire of material includes some duets and also a few songs for three voices, close university pals and fellow comedians Mark Teich (of <a href="The%20Second%20City">The Second City</a>) and Rod Cone (of The Rod Cone Situation) are also very frequent guests on his tours, and he rarely tours alone. He has also done shows with former "Wedding Singer" castmate David Josefsberg.
As of July 2008, Lynch resides in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York with his wife.
Lynch's father Leo died October 9, 2009. Although he canceled several performances as a result, Lynch still performed at <a href="Central%20Michigan%20University">Central Michigan University</a> on October 16.
Lynch appeared on "<a href="The%20Opie%20and%20Anthony%20Show">The Opie and Anthony Show</a>" on <a href="Sirius%20Satellite%20Radio">Sirius197</a> XM202 The Virus, on October 19, 2009. He stated he finally returned to his New York apartment after spending the last year in Michigan with his wife. During a subsequent appearance on May 2, 2013, to promote "Lion", Lynch stated that he had returned to Michigan after a financial downturn and creative dry spell.

Battle of the Mediterranean

The Battle of the Mediterranean was the name given to the naval campaign fought in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, from 10 June 1940 to 2 May 1945.
For the most part, the campaign was fought between the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861-1946%29">Italian</a> <a href="Regia%20Marina">Royal Navy</a> ("<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>"), supported by other <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis</a> naval and air forces, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, supported by other <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> naval forces, such as <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. US naval and air units joined the Allied side in 1942.
Each side had three overall objectives in this battle. The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side. The second was to keep open the supply lines to their own armies in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea.
Outside of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific</a> theatre, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> saw the largest conventional naval warfare actions during the conflict. In particular, Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>.
The Mediterranean was a traditional focus of British maritime power. Out-numbered by the forces of the "Regia Marina", the British plan was to hold the three decisive strategic points of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Malta, and the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. By holding these points, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Mediterranean Fleet</a> held open vital supply routes. Malta was the lynch-pin of the whole system. It provided a needed stop for Allied convoys and a base from which to attack the Axis supply routes.
Italian dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> saw the control of the Mediterranean as an essential prerequisite for expanding his "<a href="New%20Roman%20Empire">New Roman Empire</a>" into <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. Italian naval building accelerated during his tenure. Mussolini described the Mediterranean Sea as "Mare Nostrum" "<a href="Mare%20Nostrum">(our sea)</a>".
The warships of the "<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>" (Italian Royal Fleet) had a general reputation as well-designed. Italian small attack craft lived up to expectations and were responsible for many brave and successful actions in the Mediterranean. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour and all Italian warships lacked <a href="radar">radar</a> although its lack was partly offset by Italian warships being equipped with good <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> and <a href="Fire-control%20system">fire-control</a> systems for daylight combat. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion to act on their own initiative, the actions of Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters ("Supermarina").
The "Regia Marina" also lacked a proper fleet air arm. The aircraft carrier was never completed and most air support during the Battle of the Mediterranean was supplied by the land-based "<a href="Regia%20Aeronautica">Regia Aeronautica</a>" (Royal Air Force). Another major handicap for the Italians was the shortage of fuel. As early as March 1941, the overall scarcity of fuel oil was critical. Coal, gasoline and lubricants were also locally hard to find. During the Italian war effort, 75% of all the fuel oil available was used by destroyers and torpedo boats carrying out escort missions.
However, the most serious problem for the Axis forces in North Africa was the limited capacity of the <a href="Libya">Libya</a>n ports. Even under the best conditions, this restricted supplies. <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> was the largest port in Libya and it could accommodate a maximum of five large cargo vessels or four <a href="troop%20transports">troop transports</a>. On a monthly basis, Tripoli had an unloading capacity of . <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> added only another . <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> and other smaller ports added a little more.
In general, the Axis forces in North Africa exceeded the capacity of the ports to supply them. It has been calculated that the average Axis division required of supplies per month. If the Italians had a fault in respect to logistics during the Battle of the Mediterranean, it was that they failed to increase the capacity of Tripoli and the other ports before the war.
In January 1937, France began a programme of modernization and expansion. This soon elevated the French Fleet to the fourth-largest in the world. However, the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> (formally the "National Navy" - "Marine Nationale"), was still considerably smaller than the navy of its ally, Britain.
By agreement with the British Admiralty, the strongest concentration of French vessels was in the Mediterranean. Here, the Italian Fleet posed a threat to the vitally important French sea routes from metropolitan France to North Africa and to the British sea routes between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal.
In 1940, after <a href="Fall%20of%20France">France fell to the Germans</a>, the "Marine Nationale" in the Mediterranean became the navy of the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French government</a>. As the Vichy French Navy, this force was considered a potentially grave threat to the Royal Navy. As such, it was imperative to the British that this threat be neutralised.
As the opening phase of <a href="Operation%20Catapult">Operation "Catapult"</a>, the French squadron at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> was dealt-with via negotiations. This proved possible primarily because the two commanders—Admirals <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Emile%20Godfroy">René-Emile Godfroy</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Browne%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a>—were on good personal terms. In contrast, a British ultimatum to place the bulk of the remainder of the French fleet out of German reach was refused. The fleet was located at <a href="Mers-el-Kebir">Mers-el-Kebir</a> in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, so on 3 July 1940 it was <a href="Destruction%20of%20the%20French%20Fleet%20at%20Mers-el-Kebir">largely destroyed by bombardment</a> by the British "<a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>" from Gibraltar (Admiral <a href="James%20Somerville%20%28admiral%29">James Somerville</a>). The Vichy French government broke off all ties with the British as a result of this attack and the <a href="Vichy%20French%20Air%20Force">Vichy French Air Force</a> ("Armée de l'Air de Vichy") even raided <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Gibraltar%20during%20World%20War%20II">British installations at Gibraltar</a>.
In June and July 1941, a small Vichy French naval force was involved during "<a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Operation "Exporter"</a>". This was an <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> action launched against Vichy French forces based in Lebanon and Syria. French naval vessels had to be driven off before the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Litani%20River">Litani River could be crossed</a>.
In 1942, as part of the occupation of Vichy France during "<a href="Case%20Anton">Case Anton</a>", the Germans intended to capture the French fleet at <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. This was thwarted by determined action by French commanders; the <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20French%20fleet%20in%20Toulon">bulk of the fleet was scuttled at anchor</a>.
The Mediterranean <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> Campaign lasted approximately from 21 September 1941 to May 1944. <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" aimed at isolating Gibraltar, Malta, and the Suez Canal so as to break Britain's trade route to the far east. More than 60 U-boats were sent to disrupt shipping in the sea, although many were attacked in the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>, which was controlled by Britain (nine boats were sunk while attempting the passage and ten more were damaged). The "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" also played a key part in the Battle of the Mediterranean, especially during 1941. German war strategy, however, viewed the Mediterranean as a secondary theatre of operations.
On 10 June 1940, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italy</a> declared war on Britain and <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a>. On the following day, <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%28World%20War%20II%29%23Initial%20Italian%20bombings">Italian bombers attacked Malta</a> on what was to be the first of many raids. During this time, the "Marine Nationale" <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20France">shelled a number of targets on the northwestern coast of Italy</a>, in particular the port of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>. When <a href="Armistice%20with%20France%20%28Second%20Compi%C3%A8gne%29">France surrendered</a> on 24 June, the Axis leaders allowed the new Vichy French regime to retain its naval forces.
The first clash between the rival fleets—the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calabria">Battle of Calabria</a>—took place on 9 July, just four weeks after the start of hostilities. This was inconclusive, and was followed by a series of small surface actions during the summer, among them the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Espero%20Convoy">battle of the "Espero" convoy</a> and the <a href="battle%20of%20Cape%20Spada">battle of Cape Spada</a>.
To reduce the threat posed by the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian fleet</a>, which was based in the port of <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a>, to convoys sailing to Malta, Admiral Cunningham organised an attack code-named <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Operation "Judgement"</a>. <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s from attacked the Italian fleet on 11 November 1940 while it was still at anchor. This was the first time in history that an attack such as this had been attempted and was heavily studied by Japanese naval officers in preparation for the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. British <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> aircraft badly damaged two Italian <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and a third was sunk putting half of the "regia Marina"s major ships out of action for several months. This attack also forced the Italian fleet to move to Italian ports further north so as to be out of range of carrier-based aircraft. This reduced the threat of Italian sallies attacking Malta-bound convoys. Nevertheless, as early as 27 November, the Italian fleet was able to confront the Mediterranean fleet again in the indecisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Spartivento">battle of Spartivento</a>.
Nevertheless, Cunningham's estimate that Italians would be unwilling to risk their remaining heavy units was quickly proven wrong. Only five days after Taranto, Campioni sortied with two battleships, six cruisers and 14 destroyers to disrupt a supply convoy to Malta. Two of the three damaged battleships were repaired by mid-1941 and control of the Mediterranean continued to swing back and forth until the Italian armistice in 1943. Measured against its primary task of disrupting Axis convoys to Africa, the Taranto attack had little effect. In fact, Italian shipping to Libya increased between the months of October 1940–January 1941 to an average of 49,435 tons per month, up from the 37,204-ton average of the previous four months. Moreover, rather than change the balance of power in the central Mediterranean, British naval authorities had "failed to deliver the true knockout blow that would have changed the context within which the rest of the war in the Mediterranean was fought." 
The <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> was a decisive Allied victory. It was fought off the coast of the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> in southern <a href="Greece">Greece</a> from 27–29 March 1941 in which Royal Navy and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> forces—under the command of the British Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Browne%20Cunningham">Andrew Cunningham</a>—intercepted those of the Italian "Regia Marina" under Admiral <a href="Angelo%20Iachino">Angelo Iachino</a>.
The Allies sank the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s , and and the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s "Vittorio Alfieri" and "Giosue Carducci", and damaged the battleship . The British lost one torpedo plane and suffered light damage to some cruisers from "Vittorio Veneto"s salvoes.
The decisive factors in the Allied victory were the use of "<a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>" intercepts and the lack of radar on the Italian ships.
The effort to prevent German troops from reaching <a href="Crete">Crete</a> by sea, and subsequently the partial evacuation of Allied land forces after their defeat by German paratroops in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> during May 1941, cost the Allied navies a number of ships. Attacks by German planes, mainly <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a>s and <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Ju 88</a>s, sank eight British warships: two light cruisers ( and ) and six destroyers (, <a href="HMS%20Greyhound%20%28H05%29">"Greyhound"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Kashmir%20%28F12%29">"Kashmir"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Hereward%20%28H93%29">"Hereward"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Imperial%20%28D09%29">"Imperial"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Juno%20%28F46%29">"Juno"</a>). Seven other ships were damaged, including the battleships and and the light cruiser . Nearly 2,000 British sailors died.
It was a significant victory for the "Luftwaffe", as it proved that the Royal Navy could not operate in waters where the German Air Force had air supremacy without suffering severe losses. In the end, however, this had little strategic meaning, since the attention of the German Army (the "<a href="Wehrmacht%20Heer">Wehrmacht Heer</a>") was directed toward Russia (in <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation "Barbarossa"</a>) a few weeks later, and the Mediterranean was to play only a secondary role in German war planning over the following years. The action did, however, extend the Axis reach into the eastern Mediterranean, and prolong the threat to Allied convoys.
Two attempts were carried out to transport German troops by sea in <a href="ca%C3%AFque">caïque</a>s, but both of them were disrupted by Royal Navy intervention. The tiny Italian naval escorts, however, managed to save most of the vessels. Eventually, the Italians landed a force of their own near <a href="Sitia">Sitia</a> on 28 May, when the Allied withdrawal was already ongoing.
During the evacuation, Cunningham was determined that the "Navy must not let the Army down". When army generals stated their fears that he would lose too many ships, Cunningham said that "It takes three years to build a ship, it takes three centuries to build a tradition". Despite advance warning through "Ultra" intercepts, the Battle of Crete resulted in a decisive defeat for the Allies. The invasion took a fearful toll of the German paratroops, who were dropped without their major weapons, which were deliverd separately in containers. So heavy were the losses that General <a href="Kurt%20Student">Kurt Student</a>, who commanded the German invasion, would later say, referring to the German decision not to use parachutists in any future invasion attempts:
"Crete was the grave of the German parachutists." 
Malta's position between <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and North Africa was perfect to interdict Axis supply convoys destined for North Africa. It could thus influence the campaign in North Africa and support Allied actions against Italy. The Axis recognised this and made great efforts to neutralise the island as a British base, either by air attacks or by starving it of its own supplies.
For a time during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281940%29">Siege of Malta</a>, it looked as if the island would be starved into submission by the use of Axis aircraft and warships based in Sicily, Sardinia, Crete and North Africa. A number of <a href="Malta%20Convoys">Allied convoys</a> were decimated. The turning point in the siege came in August 1942, when the British sent a very heavily defended convoy under the codename <a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation "Pedestal"</a>. Malta's air defence was repeatedly reinforced by <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighters flown to the island from and other Allied aircraft carriers. The situation eased as Axis forces were forced away from their North African bases and eventually Malta could be resupplied and become an offensive base once again.
The British re-established a substantial air garrison and offensive naval base on the island. With the aid of "Ultra", Malta's garrison was able to disrupt Axis supplies to North Africa immediately before the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Second Battle of El Alamein</a>. For the fortitude and courage of the Maltese people during the siege, the island was awarded the <a href="George%20Cross">George Cross</a>.
The Royal Navy sank 3082 Axis merchantment in the Mediterranean, amounting to over 4 million tons. The loss of supplies proved fatal to the Axis armies in North Africa.
Following the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941, the Royal Navy regained its ascendancy in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks, (including the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Duisburg%20Convoy">"Duisburg" convoy</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Bon%20%281941%29">Cap Bon</a>), until the events surrounding the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">First Battle of Sirte</a> and the <a href="Raid%20on%20Alexandria%20%281941%29">Raid on Alexandria</a> in December swung the balance of power towards the Axis.
The "Regia Marina"s most successful attack was when divers attached <a href="limpet%20mines">limpet mines</a> on the hulls of British battleships during the Raid on Alexandria on 19 December 1941. The battleships and were sunk at their berths, but they were both later raised and returned to active service.
A series of hard fought convoy battles (such as the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Sirte">Second Battle of Sirte</a> in March, Operations <a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">"Harpoon"</a> and <a href="Operation%20Vigorous">"Vigorous"</a> in June and Operation "Pedestal" in August), ensured Malta's survival until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942.
In September 1943, with the Italian collapse and the surrender of the Italian fleet, naval actions in the Mediterranean became restricted to operations against U-boats and by small craft in the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> and <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> seas.
On 25 July 1943, the <a href="Grand%20Council%20of%20Fascism">Grand Council of Fascism</a> ousted Mussolini. A new Italian government, led by <a href="Victor%20Emmanuel%20III%20of%20Italy">King Victor Emmanuel III</a> and Marshal <a href="Pietro%20Badoglio">Pietro Badoglio</a>, immediately began secret negotiations with the Allies to end the fighting and to come over to the Allied side. On 3 September, a secret <a href="Armistice%20with%20Italy">armistice</a> was signed with the Allies at Fairfield Camp in Sicily. The armistice was announced on 8 September.
After the armistice, the Italian Navy was split in two. In southern Italy, the "<a href="Italian%20Co-Belligerent%20Navy">Co-Belligerent Navy of the South</a>" ("Marina Cobelligerante del Sud") fought for the King and Badoglio. In the north, a much smaller portion of the "Regia Marina" joined the Republican National Navy ("Marina Nazionale Repubblicana") of Mussolini's new <a href="Italian%20Social%20Republic">Italian Social Republic</a> ("Repubblica Sociale Italiana", or RSI) and fought on for the Germans.

Vrana Palace

Vrana Palace (, "Dvorets „Vrana“") is a former royal palace, located on the outskirts of <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, the capital of <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. It is today the official residence of <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Simeon%20II%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon II of Bulgaria</a> and his wife Tsaritsa <a href="Margarita%20of%20Bulgaria">Margarita</a>. While the Royal palace in the centre of Sofia (today the <a href="National%20Art%20Gallery%20%28Bulgaria%29">National Art Gallery</a> and <a href="National%20Ethnographic%20Museum">National Ethnographic Museum</a>) served representative purposes and the <a href="Euxinograd">Euxinograd</a> palace near <a href="Varna">Varna</a> was a summer residence, Vrana was the palace where the <a href="Royal%20House%20of%20Bulgaria">royal family of Bulgaria</a> spent most of their time. Vrana Palace is situated at an elevation of 571 m.
The extensive lot was bought by Tsar <a href="Ferdinand%20of%20Bulgaria">Ferdinand I</a> in 1898 and is situated just outside Sofia. There is a large park and two buildings, the first one built in 1904 as a two-storey hunting lodge commissioned to <a href="Georgi%20Fingov">Georgi Fingov</a>, and the second constructed mainly between 1909 and 1914 as a palace, both with money from the state budget. The earliest building in the complex, the hunting lodge, has been described architecturally as an "exquisite interpretation of the <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> <a href="Baroque%20architecture">baroque</a> with <a href="Vienna">Viennese</a> decorative elements".
Three rooms of the three-storey palace commissioned to the noted architect <a href="Nikola%20Lazarov">Nikola Lazarov</a> were later furnished in the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> style, one in the style of the <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n royal palaces and one in a Bulgarian national style, while the study was designed in a <a href="Venice">Venetian</a> style. The palace features a <a href="wood%20carving">carved wooden</a> ceiling, oak <a href="wainscoting">wainscoting</a>, built-in metal plates and <a href="Delftware">Delftware</a>. The interior columns are made of <a href="Carrara">Carrara</a> marble and an old <a href="Schindler%20Group">Schindler</a> lift is still in use. In terms of architecture, the Vrana Palace combines <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">Byzantine</a> influences, <a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Revival">Bulgarian National Revival</a> traditions, <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> and <a href="France">French</a> <a href="classicism">classicism</a>.
The <a href="Karelia">Karelia</a>n Hall is a gift from <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a>, and all of its furniture (the table, the chairs and the dressing table) are made of Karelian <a href="birch">birch</a> by master woodworkers specially sent from Russia. The first storey also has a cinema hall and tea halls, the second storey is where the apartments are located, and the third one used to be allocated to the servants and the court.
In 1918 Vrana passed from Tsar Ferdinand to <a href="Boris%20III">Boris III</a>. Here he faced the new government after the military coup on 9 June 1923. In August 1943, it became the property of Simeon II. The main palace was bombed by the <a href="RAF">RAF</a> in 1943-44 during the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and after partially damaged, it was subsequently restored in 1947. After the abolition of the monarchy, Vrana was taken by the <a href="Bulgarian%20Communist%20Party">communists</a> and became a residence of <a href="Georgi%20Dimitrov">Georgi Dimitrov</a>.
After the fall of the communist regime, Vrana was returned to the last tsar, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and his sister Princess Maria Luisa, by the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Bulgaria">Constitutional Court of Bulgaria</a> in June 1998, and the park was donated by the royal family to the city of Sofia in October 1999, making it possible for the former royal park, arranged in 1903 by Ferdinand, to be opened to the public. Simeon moved with his wife Margarita into the renovated old hunting lodge in spring 2001. , the 0.968-square-kilometre park is opened to the public. The park is home to over 400 plant species and has been declared a national monument of <a href="landscape%20architecture">landscape architecture</a>. Among the <a href="landscape%20art">landscape art</a>ists who have worked on the Vrana Park include V. Georgiev, K.

The palace, along with the other properties given back to Simeon II, has been the subject of much controversy in the Bulgarian media and society in the 2000s, as many argue they are in fact supposed to be public property. Since June 2013, the park has been opened to the public on weekends. The special public transport bus 505, which only runs on weekends during the park's opening hours, connects the palace with <a href="Eagles%27%20Bridge">Eagles' Bridge</a>.

His <a href="nickname">nickname</a> was "Joe Table," the <a href="literal%20translation">literal translation</a> of his name in the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>.
Mesa was initially signed as an amateur free agent by the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in , originally as an <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a>. He was traded to the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>, during the season for <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> <a href="Mike%20Flanagan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Flanagan</a>. Mesa began his major-league career as a starting pitcher with the Orioles, who hoped that Mesa's superior fastball would earn him success in the starting role. After 48 starts of below-average results during four seasons, the Orioles traded Mesa to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> in . Cleveland continued to use Mesa as a starter through the end of ; that year, Mesa pitched a career-high 208-2/3 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a>, although his <a href="earned-run%20average">earned-run average</a> was worse than the league average ERA for the fifth consecutive season.
Mesa became a <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a> for the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> in , and for the first season of his career, he posted an ERA better than the league average. In the role of <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> during the season, Mesa pitched superbly; in 64 innings pitched over 62 appearances, Mesa had a 1.12 ERA, saved 46 games, and won three. Thirty-eight of Mesa's 46 saves were recorded in consecutive appearances in save situations; this was a major-league record at the time. Mesa's performance in 1995 was instrumental in the Indians' 100–44 regular-season record and their first <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> appearance since . In , Mesa's 2.40 ERA, 16 <a href="Save%20%28sport%29">saves</a>, and four wins helped the Indians to their second World Series appearance in three seasons; however, he failed to hold a one-run lead in the ninth inning of Game 7 of the <a href="1997%20World%20Series">1997 World Series</a>, and Cleveland traded him mid-way through the following season. Following his departure from Cleveland, he pitched for the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>, but without much success. In 2001, he signed with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> and enjoyed a two-year run of success. However, in 2003 his ERA more than doubled, and he was granted free agency at the end of the season. He spent 2004 and 2005 pitching for the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, and pitched for the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> in 2006.
On December 10, , he signed with the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. He was released by the team on June 3, . In 16 appearances with the team, he was 1-1 with a 12.34 ERA. On June 8, 2007 he signed a minor league deal with the Phillies. He appeared in 40 games for the Phillies, compiling a 1-2 record with a 5.54 ERA, and retired following the 2007 season.
Mesa was involved in a longstanding feud with former teammate <a href="Omar%20Vizquel">Omar Vizquel</a> following the publication of Vizquel's autobiography, "Omar! My Life On and Off the Field". In the book, Vizquel criticized Mesa's performance in <a href="1997%20World%20Series%23Game%207">Game 7 of the 1997 World Series</a>: "The eyes of the world were focused on every move we made. Unfortunately, Jose's own eyes were vacant. Completely empty. Nobody home. You could almost see right through him. Not long after I looked into his vacant eyes, he blew the save and the Marlins tied the game." Mesa reacted furiously, pledging to hit Vizquel upon every subsequent opportunity: "Even my little boy told me to get him. If I face him 10 more times, I'll hit him 10 times. I want to kill him." By the end of the 2007 season, Mesa had hit Vizquel twice. Vizquel expressed regret in 2014 about what happened due to his comments about Mesa (which he also stated were misinterpreted) but Mesa and Vizuqel have never reconciled, to the point where Mesa said he hadn't spoken to Vizquel in over a decade and had no plans to ever talk to him again.
Mesa was charged with one count of rape for allegedly penetrating one woman with his finger and two counts of gross sexual imposition for allegedly groping two women in a <a href="Lakewood%2C%20Ohio">Lakewood, Ohio</a> motel room on December 22, 1996. Mesa was acquitted of all charges on April 9, 1997.

Epsom Downs railway station

Epsom Downs railway station is a railway station located on the boundary of the <a href="Reigate%20and%20Banstead">Reigate and Banstead</a> and <a href="Epsom%20and%20Ewell">Epsom and Ewell</a> boroughs of <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> with the railway to the north forming a continuation of the boundary.
The station, and all trains serving it, is operated by <a href="Southern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southern</a>, although a terminus of its own branch line is grouped as part of the <a href="Sutton%20%26amp%3B%20Mole%20Valley%20Line">Sutton &amp; Mole Valley Line</a>s.
Epsom Downs is also served by station, which is on the <a href="Tattenham%20Corner%20Line">Tattenham Corner Line</a> and is also served by Southern.
With high levels of passengers travelling to <a href="Epsom">Epsom</a> for horse races, it became clear that a station near the course was needed. Attempts to build one immediately next to it were strongly opposed by the <a href="Epsom%20Grandstand%20Association">Epsom Grandstand Association</a> and eventually land was purchased half a mile from the course. Designed by David J.Field, the original station was opened on 22 May 1865 on the <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a>'s extension from Sutton. The line had double track and a nine-platform station with a large building.
With the opening of <a href="Tattenham%20Corner%20railway%20station">Tattenham Corner railway station</a> much closer to the racecourse on 4 June 1901 (<a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby Day</a>) traffic declined, helped in particular by the <a href="British%20Royal%20Train">Royal Train</a> changing its destination to Tattenham Corner in 1925. Services were cut back repeatedly over subsequent decades. On 1 May 1972 the number of working platforms was reduced to two, and following the destruction by fire of Epsom Downs signal box in November 1981 almost the entire branch was reduced to single track operation in October 1982.
On 13 February 1989 a new station was opened short of the original one. The old station and platforms were demolished and the land in between given over to a major housing development. The replacement station was installed by <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> under the <a href="Network%20Southeast">Network Southeast</a> sector.
The typical off-peak service from the station is one train per hour to <a href="Victoria%20Station%20%28London%29">London Victoria</a> via <a href="Sutton%20railway%20station%20%28London%29">Sutton</a>, <a href="West%20Croydon%20station">West Croydon</a> and <a href="Norbury%20railway%20station">Norbury</a>. After 7pm these services run via <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20railway%20station">Crystal Palace</a> rather than Norbury. There is no service on a Sunday.

It causes severe growth failure (<a href="dwarfism">dwarfism</a>) along with abnormalities of the heart, muscle, liver, brain and eye. Mulibrey nanism has been associated with a recessive defect in the gene <a href="TRIM37">TRIM37</a>. TRIM37 is responsible for various cellular functions including developmental patterning.
A person with Mulibrey nanism has growth retardation, a short broad neck, misshapen sternum, small thorax, square shoulders, triangular face, unusual voice, enlarged liver, and yellowish dots in the ocular fundi. Individuals with Mulibrey nanism have also been reported to have mental retardation, tumors, and infertility.
Mulibrey nanism is caused by mutations of the TRIM37 gene, located at human <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> <a href="chromosome%2017%20%28human%29">17q22-23</a>. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an <a href="autosome">autosome</a> (chromosome 17 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both <a href="genetic%20carrier">carry</a> one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.
A rare disease, Mulibrey nanism may be a <a href="Finnish%20heritage%20disease">Finnish heritage disease</a>. Worldwide, it has been documented in 110 persons, 85 of them <a href="Finns">Finnish</a>. It is a <a href="recessive">recessive</a> genetic disease. Many people with Mulibrey nanism have parents who are closely related (<a href="consanguine">consanguine</a>).

Woodland Critter Christmas

"Woodland Critter Christmas" is episode 125 of the <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It originally aired on December 15, 2004. It was the last episode of the series to have a Christmas theme for ten years until 2014's "<a href="HappyHolograms">#HappyHolograms</a>".
In the summer of 2013, fans voted "Woodland Critter Christmas" as the best episode of season 8.
This episode, which like many routine Christmas specials has an <a href="anapest">anapest</a>ic rhyming narration and storybook style, begins in the forest, where "<a href="Stan%20Marsh">the boy in the red poof-ball hat</a>" discovers a group of <a href="Talking%20animals%20in%20fiction">talking animal</a>s building a Christmas tree. They convince a surprised but apathetic Stan to help make a star for their <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a> before he goes home. That night, they wake him in his room and explain that one of the animals, a <a href="porcupine">porcupine</a> named Porcupiney, is <a href="pregnant">pregnant</a> with the creatures' <a href="wiktionary%3ASavior">Savior</a>. Drowsy and annoyed, Stan nevertheless agrees to help them build a manger for the baby. However, another problem soon appears: the Critters explain that one of their members conceives their Savior every year, only for the pregnant animal to be killed by a <a href="mountain%20lion">mountain lion</a>. Exasperated, Stan goes to its mountain and manages to kill the beast (by tricking her into jumping off a ledge), but is dismayed to find that the lion was the mother of three now-orphaned cubs. Stan is further horrified to discover that the woodland critters are <a href="Satan%20worship">Satan worship</a>pers, and that their Savior is actually the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>. They celebrate Stan's victory by sacrificing Rabbitty the Rabbit (much to his delight), devouring his flesh and having an orgy with his blood. 
After much coercion from the narrator, Stan tries to stop the animals himself. But they easily rebuff him with their <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a> powers, which will apparently grow stronger as the Antichrist's birth approaches. Since the Critters claims that only a mountain lion can kill the Antichrist, Stan (heeding the narrator's instructions) returns to the mountain to enlist the orphaned cubs. Since they're too small to take on the Critters, however, they can only stop the birth by learning to perform <a href="abortion">abortion</a>s. (Stan refuses to bring them to the town's abortion clinic, but the narrator simply forces him using a scene cut.) Meanwhile, the evil Critters are searching for a human host for the Antichrist, who must have never been baptized. They discover <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a>, who is <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>, and kidnap him to serve their purpose.
Stan returns in time to discover that the Antichrist (a hairless, jabbering little creature) has already been born, and that his best friend Kyle is tied to a Satanic <a href="altar">altar</a>. <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> arrives and, when he learns what is happening, pulls out a shotgun and slaughters all the Critters. He explains that the Antichrist will die without a human host to inhabit, but Kyle – now free from the altar – suddenly decides to allow the Antichrist to possess him, declaring that he will conqueror the world in the name of the Jews...
The scene suddenly cuts to <a href="Herbert%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a>'s fourth-grade class, revealing that the entire episode up until now has been a story read by <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Eric Cartman</a> for a class assignment to write a Christmas story. Kyle objects to its obvious <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, and Mr. Garrison, fearing complaints from <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Gerald%20and%20Sheila%20Broflovski">Kyle's mother</a>, forces Cartman to stop. However, the rest of the class want to hear the ending and plead with Kyle to let Cartman continue; Kyle objects that the ending is obvious, that Kyle (in the story) will merely be killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved. Cartman says that that is not the ending, and as the other kids persist, Kyle angrily allows Cartman to continue.
Back in the story, Kyle begins to react with horror at how evil the Antichrist feels and begs the others to get it out of him. Santa, however, says that they have no choice but to kill Kyle before the Antichrist can consume his soul and take full control of him. Thinking quickly, Stan has the lion cubs perform an abortion on Kyle's <a href="anus">anus</a>, removing the Antichrist, which Santa unceremoniously smashes with a <a href="sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>. Santa gives Stan a special Christmas wish, which Stan uses to <a href="resurrect">resurrect</a> the mountain lion he killed. Everyone then goes home to a happy Christmas. The narrator (i.e, Cartman) concludes, "they all lived happily ever after, except for Kyle, who died of <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> two weeks later", as seen with an image of a sickly Kyle in the hospital. The episode ends with a Christmas-themed title card reading, "The End," and the real Kyle (unseen) shouting, "Goddammit, Cartman!"
According to this episode's mini-commentary, this episode was one of the most difficult to make. After making the feature film ' and the 13 other episodes in "South Park"'s 8th season all in 2004 (a year which Trey Parker and Matt Stone describe as "The Year from Hell"), Parker, Stone and the show's other writers were completely drained of ideas. The staff tried to come up with an idea, but nothing came up through Thursday and Friday which is considered a huge drawback with "South Park"'s rushed production. On Saturday afternoon the staff decided to just do the idea of parodying ' holiday special, which had been in gestation for some time. The critters participate in Satanic behavior like the possessed crew of the 1997 movie "<a href="Event%20Horizon%20%28film%29">Event Horizon</a>", which also inspired Stone and Parker to create the characters. With some doubt, the show developed into an episode involving a rhyming narration and ending with it being a story by Cartman. The episode was also in the style of Christmas stories such as "<a href="How%20the%20Grinch%20Stole%20Christmas">How the Grinch Stole Christmas</a>".

<doc id="1639916" title="Everybody Hurts" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639916">
Everybody Hurts

"Everybody Hurts" is a song by <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, originally released on the band's 1992 album "<a href="Automatic%20for%20the%20People">Automatic for the People</a>" and was also released as a single in 1993. It peaked at number twenty nine on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and France.
Much of the song was written by drummer <a href="Bill%20Berry">Bill Berry</a>, although as R.E.M. shares songwriting credits among its members, it is unknown how much he actually wrote. Berry did not drum on the song—a <a href="Univox">Univox</a> <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a> took his place—but he was responsible for the sampling of the drum pattern on the track. The string arrangement was written by <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> bassist <a href="John%20Paul%20Jones%20%28musician%29">John Paul Jones</a>.
Guitarist <a href="Peter%20Buck">Peter Buck</a> commented on the making of the track saying "'Everybody Hurts' is similar to '<a href="Man%20on%20the%20Moon%20%28song%29">Man on the Moon</a>'. Bill brought it in, and it was a one-minute long <a href="Country%20music">country-and-western</a> song. It didn't have a <a href="Refrain">chorus</a> or a <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>. It had the <a href="Verse%20%28music%29%23Verse">verse</a> . . . it kind of went around and around, and he was strumming it. We went through about four different ideas and how to approach it and eventually came to that <a href="Stax%20Records">Stax</a>, <a href="Otis%20Redding">Otis Redding</a>, "Pain in My Heart" kind of vibe. I'm not sure if Michael would have copped that reference, but to a lot of our fans it was a Staxxy-type thing. It took us forever to figure out the arrangement and who was going to play what, and then Bill ended up not playing on the original track. It was me and Mike and a drum machine. And then we all overdubbed."
In the liner notes of the album "", Buck writes that "the reason the lyrics are so atypically straightforward is because it was aimed at teenagers", and "I've never watched "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>", but the idea that high school is a <a href="Hellmouth%20%28Buffyverse%29">portal to hell</a> seems pretty realistic to me." Incidentally, the song was used in the <a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28film%29">1992 film of the same name</a> that preceded the show.
In 2005, Buck told the BBC: "If you're consciously writing for someone who hasn't been to college, or is pretty young, it might be nice to be very direct. In that regard, it's tended to work for people of a lot of ages."
In the <a href="music%20video">video</a> for the song, directed by <a href="Jake%20Scott%20%28director%29">Jake Scott</a> and filmed along the double deck portions of <a href="I-10">I-10</a> near the I-35 Interchange in Downtown <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio, Texas</a>, the band is stuck in a traffic jam. It shows the people in other cars and subtitles of their thoughts appear on screen. At the end, all the people leave their cars and walk instead; then they vanish. The video was heavily inspired by the traffic jam in the opening dream sequence of <a href="Fellini">Fellini</a>'s "<a href="8%C2%BD">8½</a>".
In 1995, British emotional support listening service <a href="The%20Samaritans">The Samaritans</a>, in response to the high suicide rate but low crisis service take-up amongst young men, launched a UK press advertising campaign consisting solely of the lyrics to "Everybody Hurts" and the charity's hotline number.
The song was placed on R.E.M.'s <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> "best of" album "" in 2003. It was one of four songs from "Automatic for the People" to make the compilation, more than from any other album.
The song is included on "<a href="R.E.M.%20Live">R.E.M. Live</a>".
All songs written by <a href="Bill%20Berry">Bill Berry</a>, <a href="Peter%20Buck">Peter Buck</a>, <a href="Mike%20Mills">Mike Mills</a> and <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> unless otherwise indicated.
The track sold 205,000 in the UK.
In an attempt to raise money for victims of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, British Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> asked <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> to arrange a <a href="charity%20record">charity single</a>. Cowell chose "Everybody Hurts", Brown agreed to waive <a href="Value%20added%20tax">VAT</a> on the single and R.E.M. agreed to waive all royalties. The release was under the name Helping Haiti.
Proceeds from the single were split between "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28newspaper%29">The Sun</a>" Helping Haiti fund and the <a href="Disasters%20Emergency%20Committee">Disasters Emergency Committee</a>. The song was premiered on radio stations nationally on February 2, 2010. The single was released both physically and digitally on February 7, 2010, with the physical release being brought forward by one day due to demand.
It has been reported as having sold approximately 205,000 copies in its first two days in the United Kingdom, and 453,000 in its first week, making it the fastest-selling charity record of the 21st century in Britain.
The song is performed by the following artists (in order of appearance):
A five-minute promotional short documentary was broadcast on <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20channel%29">ITV</a> at 20.30 on February 7. The documentary includes footage of the performers recording their vocals (except for Carey, Cyrus, Bon Jovi and Minogue) and images and footage from the aftermath of the earthquake. It opens with a statement of what had happened on January 12 and moves on with footage showing the devastation in the country and the suffering of the Haitians. The official music video was directed by <a href="Joseph%20Kahn">Joseph Kahn</a> and premiered on March 6, 2010. Jon Bon Jovi is the only artist not to appear in this video.

He was born in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> to <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="George%20Taylor%20Denison%20II">George Taylor Denison II</a>, and educated at <a href="Upper%20Canada%20College">Upper Canada College</a>. In 1861 he was called to the bar, and was from 1865-1867 a member of the <a href="Toronto%20City%20Council">city council</a>. From the first he took a prominent part in the organization of the military forces of Canada, becoming a <a href="lieutenant-colonel">lieutenant-colonel</a> in the active militia in 1866. He saw active service during the <a href="Fenian%20raids">Fenian raids</a> of 1866, and during the <a href="North-West%20Rebellion">North-West Rebellion</a> of 1885.
Owing to his dissatisfaction with the conduct of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historic%29">Conservative ministry</a> during the <a href="Red%20River%20Rebellion">Red River Rebellion</a> in 1869-70, he abandoned that party, and in 1872 unsuccessfully contested <a href="Algoma%20%28electoral%20district%29">Algoma</a> in the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a> interest. Thereafter he remained free from party ties. In 1877 he was appointed police magistrate of Toronto.
Colonel Denison was one of the founders of the <a href="Canada%20First">Canada First</a> movement, which did much to shape the national aspirations from 1870 to 1878, and was a consistent supporter of imperial federation and of preferential trade between Great Britain and her colonies. He became a member of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Canada">Royal Society of Canada</a>, and was president of the section dealing with English history and literature. The best known of his military works is his "History of Modern Cavalry" (London, 1877), which was awarded the Czar of Russia Prize in an open competition in 1879, and has been translated into German, Russian and Japanese. It remains one of the definitive works on the subject. In 1900 he published his reminiscences under the title of "Soldiering in Canada".
He was a public defender of Upper Canada College, and was also known for virulent Anti-Americanism; after a proposal was made to erect a statue of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, he threatened that if it were built, he would go there to spit on it. Following the attempts by the <a href="Fenian%20raids">Fenian raiders</a> to "liberate" Canada between 1866 and 1871, Denison claimed a Yankee sword from the battlefield for a <a href="Fireplace%20poker">poker</a> on his fire.
Denison died in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> in 1925 and buried at a family plot in <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Cemetery%20on%20the%20Humber%20">St. John's Cemetery on the Humber </a> in <a href="Weston%2C%20Toronto">Weston</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>.

Morab

The Morab is a breed of <a href="horse">horse</a> originally developed through the <a href="cross-breeding">cross-breeding</a> of <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> and <a href="Morgan%20horse">Morgan</a> horses. The breeding of Morab horses began in the late 1880s with the intent of creating a fine <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">carriage horse</a> that was still substantial enough for moderate farm labor. The modern Morab continues this tradition of paired power and elegance, being both attractive and competitive show animals, and strong but mild-mannered work and family horses.
The first Morab <a href="breed%20registry">registry</a> was created in 1973. Prior to this, Morabs were primarily undocumented horses bred for type. Many early Morabs were registered with the American Morgan Horse Association, as the Morgan studbook was still open that time, and these horses have since been fully assimilated into the Morgan breed.
Newspaper tycoon <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> was an avid Morab breeder, and is credited with the creation of the breed name by coining the term, "Morab", as a combination of the names of the parent breeds.
The Morab is a breed developed from <a href="Arabian%20Horse">Arabian</a> and <a href="Morgan%20Horse">Morgan</a> lineage, and retains many characteristics of both breeds. Typical conformation is compact, with powerful but sleek muscle structure and substantial bone structure, while remaining refined and elegant. The Morab's neck is deep-set, strong, and arched, providing for easy breathing and fluid mobility. Morabs, like some other horse breeds of heavy Arabian ancestry, have a compact build and shorter back length, with a well-developed undercarriage and good propulsion from behind.
The Morab's hindquarters are generally powerfully built, possessing substantial muscle and bone. The forequarters are typically built very strongly as well, with a large, sloping shoulder and wide deep chest. Legs are rather thick, due to Morgan-influenced bone structure. They have comparatively short cannon bones, and solid, well-developed <a href="horse%20hoof">hooves</a>.
The Morab head is generally very refined, carrying the Arabian's concave profile and wide forehead to some degree, while also displaying a more strongly muscled jaw and more substantial muzzle, typical of Morgan influence. The eyes are large, bright, and expressive, and afford the horse a very wide field of vision. The ears are generally small and alert, and are often fluted or tipped. Many Morabs have a thick and abundant <a href="mane%20%28horse%29">mane</a> and tail, often wavy and flowing, and "flagged" tail carriage, indicative of both Morgan and Arabian parantage.
The size range of Morabs is quite broad, due to the involvement of extensive lineages from both Arabian and Morgan breeds. Generally, Morabs stand between high, but individuals can range from or larger.
The Morab's temperament and personality is best described as a true combination of the Morgan and the Arabian. Morabs are generally very intelligent, curious, and personal horses. They are often very quick to learn, and establish strong relationships with humans, who they are eager to please. Morabs make excellent family horses, and are sometimes used as lesson and <a href="Therapeutic%20horseback%20riding">therapy</a> horses.
All solid colors exist within the Morab breed, with <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a>, <a href="Chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>, and <a href="Gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a> being the most common. Dilution-factor coloration, such as <a href="Buckskin%20%28horse%29">buckskin</a> and <a href="palomino">palomino</a>, also occurs frequently, owing largely to Morgan influence, as dilution-factor genes do not occur in the Arabian breed. <a href="Tobiano">Tobiano</a>, <a href="overo">overo</a>, and <a href="Appaloosa">Appaloosa</a> colorations are not acceptable, as neither parent breed displays such patterns. <a href="Roan%20%28horse%29">Roaning</a> is occasionally seen, as is the <a href="Dun%20gene">dun</a> pattern, although both are rare in the Morab.
<a href="Horse%20markings">White markings</a> on the face and legs are acceptable, and are somewhat common.
The <a href="sabino%20horse">sabino</a> spotting pattern does occur in some Morabs, due to the presence of sabino coloration in select Arabian bloodlines used in foundation Morab breeding.
Most Morabs display only the 'natural' <a href="Horse%20gait">gaits</a> - walk, trot, and canter. Variation in the speed and action of these gaits differs greatly between individuals, due to diversity of type in the Morgan and Arabian breeds. The Morab is often noted for the fluidity and elegance of its motion, which has been described as "floating" or "flowing".
Morabs are typically not <a href="Ambling">gaited</a>. However, due to inherited genetic variation from select Morgan bloodlines capable of producing gait, a few individual Morabs are able to perform ambling, or intermediate, gaits. The most common intermediate gait in such morabs is the singlefoot, also known as the 'stepping pace'. Other known gaits are the foxtrot and the true rack.
In 1857, D. C. Lindsley, a notable horse historian, wrote an essay entitled "The Morgan Horse". In the essay, he recommended cross-breeding Morgans with Arabian mares if no pure-blood Morgan mares could be obtained, leading to a cross-breed which became known as the Morab.
One of the descendants of these crosses was Golddust, a famous walker and trotting horse who was very successful in the show ring and on the race track. He sired 302 foals, and over 100 Morab horses today can be traced back to him.
The next mention of Morgan-Arabian cross-breeds comes in the 1920s. Publisher <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> had an extensive Arabian breeding program and a short-lived, but important, Morgan program, which included a program of breeding Morabs. Hearst is credited with having coined the word "Morab" for crosses between the two breeds.
Hearst bred Morabs by crossing <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbett-bred</a> Arabian stallions to working Morgan mares. Mrs. William Randolph Hearst II said in her book "Horses of San Simeon" that Hearst, "... found the produce were excellent for work on his California Ranch." "He registered 110 horses in the AMHA, 18 of which were Morabs", she said. Quoted in an early American Morab Horse Association Brochure, "According to A. J. Cooke of the Hearst Corp, Sunical Div. … Hearst bred Morabs in the 1930’s and 1940’s for ranch work … and were desirable for the large, rough, mountainous terrain of the Hearst Ranches."
Another Morab breeding program was developed by the Swenson Brothers near <a href="Stamford%2C%20Texas">Stamford, Texas</a> on their SMS Ranch. Starting from two Morgan stud colts, seven Morgan brood mares, and three Arabian stallions, their program created several notable Morab horses.
Another highly influential breeding program was established in <a href="Clovis%2C%20California">Clovis, California</a>, by one Martha Doyle Fuller. In 1955, after several disappointing attempts to breed a horse that could successfully compete on the open show circuit, Mrs. Fuller developed a Morab breeding program focusing on show discipline capability and what she called "Morab type".
Closely associated with the breeding program of Martha Fuller, the American Morab Horse Association, Inc. was founded on July 19, 1973. This first Morab registry was also called 'Morab Horse Registry of America', and is often known as the 'Clovis' registry after its resident township. The registry's primary intent was the documentation of horses of Morab breeding and type, regardless of purity of registered bloodlines. In 1978, a maximum-minimum bloodline percentage ratio of 25%/75% was established, with either breed expressing one half of the ratio.
Upon the death of Martha Fuller in the early 1980s, the American Morab Horse Association was closed. Shortly following the closure, the North American Morab Horse Association (NAMHA) was founded, with the primary goal of providing an organization for the registration and promotion of Morabs so the breed could continue. It was agreed to accept all horses registered with the Clovis-based registry, despite the (initially unknown) fact that a large number of thes horses were registered on "type" rather than pedigree. After transferring the pedigrees of a number of horses from previous registries, it was noticed that many registered Morabs displayed unknown lineage, and were therefore did not meet a purebreeding standard. In light of this, NAMHA administration began a process of organizational restructuring, focusing on defining the qualifications for Morab horse registry.
In 1987 the International Morab Breeders' Association, Inc. (IMBA) was incorporated and continues today, in conjunction with the International Morab Registry (IMR), a <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a> emphasizing true Morab type based on Morgan and Arabian lineage. As did the Morgan Registry, the Association "originally" accepted any Morab that was registered with any of the prior Morab registry, regardless of pedigree, in an effort to protect breed history and maintain continuity. Since 1987 all new Morabs must meet pedigree standards. In addition, the International Half Morab Registry was started in 1997 to register horses with one known Morab parent.<a href="http%3A//www.morab.com"></a>
In early 1998, NAMHA resurfaced within the Purebred Morab Horse Association (PMHA). The focus of the PMHA is to promote horses of only documented purebred Morgan and Arabian parentage. Horses from the Hearst Memorial Registry and NAMHA remain active in the PMHA, but are not used for continuity of the breed, and are given separate award programs. The NAMHA is no longer open for new registration.
In 1999, a third registry was created in Illinois, called the Morab Horse Association and Register, or MHA. MHA was very active in the promotion of the Morab breed throughout the country, especially in the Midwest. MHA attended both the Midwest Horse Expo and the Minnesota Horse Expo, in addition to being invited to Breyerfest at the Kentucky Horse Park. The MHA also offered a national championship show, entitled the United Classic, which was a Class A breed show with the Arabian and Morgan horse registries. In 2008 the MHA registry merged into the PMHA. This merger was complete by late 2009, retaining the name of PMHA but carrying on many of the programs developed by both organizations.

Clive Strutt

Clive Edward Hazzard Strutt (born 19 April 1942) is an English composer. He was born in <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>, Hampshire, England, and he was educated at Farnborough Grammar School.
Strutt lives on the island of <a href="South%20Ronaldsay">South Ronaldsay</a> in <a href="Orkney%20Islands">Orkney</a>, Scotland. He studied composition under <a href="Lennox%20Berkeley">Lennox Berkeley</a>, orchestration under <a href="Leighton%20Lucas">Leighton Lucas</a>, and piano with Robert O. Edwards, Georgina Smith, and <a href="Hamish%20Milne">Hamish Milne</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, London. He also studied the viola for one year under <a href="Watson%20Forbes">Watson Forbes</a>. He is very interested in the music of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, and has visited <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a> several times. He is also a <a href="philatelist">philatelist</a>, and an authority on the <a href="Universal%20Postal%20Union">Universal Postal Union</a>. Among all these talents Strutt was also a <a href="philatelist">philatelist</a> and a member of the <a href="Universal%20Postal%20Union">Universal Postal Union</a>.
Strutt's works have been performed in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Serbia, Switzerland, as well as in the UK, Ireland, Canada and the USA. A large number of his scores are available from the Scottish Music Centre (SMS), <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, the <a href="Library%20Bo%C5%BEidar%20Kantu%C5%A1er">Bibliothèque Božidar Kantušer</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and more recent ones from Amoris International &amp; Amoris Imprint, <a href="Vouvry">Vouvry</a>, Switzerland.
The Symphony No. 1 in E minor (a student work composed during 1962–63 whilst Strutt was at the Royal Academy of Music, London) was submitted for the Division V Composition Examination in 1964 and was awarded the Manson Bequest for Composition. A four-movement large-scale piece for large orchestra (including 2 bassett horns, piano, organ, 8 French horns, 4 trumpets, and a large body of strings), and lasting one hour, it is dedicated to the memory of the great Victorian engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, whose achievements had impressed the composer and were a source of inspiration to him.
The money from the Manson Bequest enabled the composer to spend the summer in the Highlands of Scotland at Loch Kishorn, in Wester Ross, where he was able to make good headway on the composition of the symphony No. 2 in C minor, also in four movements. Scored for an orchestra of more conventional size this work plays for some 57 minutes, and includes a chorus singing wordlessly in the second movement, and, in the finale, singing a text of one line only, taken from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s epic, the "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", "Sunt lacrimae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt" ("These are the tears of things which pierce the universal heart"). The second movement is based on the Romanesca bass as a <a href="passacaglia">passacaglia</a> theme, and the following slow movement attempts to reflect an experience which the composer had during a highland holiday. One evening while staying at the <a href="Carbisdale%20Castle">Carbisdale Castle</a> youth hostel on the Firth of Sutherland he walked up the hill behind the castle and was deeply impressed by the total and absolute silence: no sound of human voices, or bird calls, no mechanical noise, and not even the sound of the wind. Paradoxically, then, the music attempts to convey the impression of silence. The original part for organ in the score was minimal, and was removed in 1991 on the revision of the symphony. The score was taken on a visit that Strutt made to the home of the composer <a href="Havergal%20Brian">Havergal Brian</a> in Shoreham-by-Sea, and was read through by Brian for his approval as the dedicatee. This happened a couple of years before Brian's death in the 1970s.
With his Symphony No.3 in E-flat major subtitled "Visions of <a href="Albion">Albion</a>" Strutt moved into the world of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, and expanded his own symphonic ambitions even further. In seven movements for large orchestra (including quadruple woodwind, a quartet of saxophones, 6 horns, 5 trumpets, harpsichord, two mandolins, two harps, organ, as well as a tenor soloist, a boys' two-part choir and a double mixed chorus), and lasting 75 minutes, this work clearly betrays the influence of Mahler.The inspirational origin of the work lay, however, in the simple act of walking along a very rocky and boulder-strewn shore at Loch Kishorn during his stay there in 1964, and observing the dense texture of rocks and vegetation which translated itself into a similar musical texture forming part of the first movement entitled "Vision of Nature". Most of the movements are prefaced with quotations from <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, in this case "All things begin and end in Albion's Ancient Druid Rocky Shore" from his prophetic poem "Jerusalem:The Emanation of the Great Albion". Movement II "Camelot" bears the quotation "Great Things are done when Men and Mountains meet;/This is not done by Jostling in the Street". Movements III and IV are both songs. III "The Schoolboy", and IV "<a href="The%20Garden%20of%20Love">The Garden of Love</a>" are settings of Blake poems, the first for boys'choir, and the second for tenor solo.Movement V "The Holy Oblation" has prominent parts for harpsichord and trumpets, and is prefaced with the Blake quotation "What is Grand is necessarily obscure to Weak men. That which can be Explicit to the Idiot is not worth my care". The sixth movement "Avalon", another reference to the Arthurian legends, is the real slow movement; its prefatory quotation is "We impose on one another, and it is but lost time to converse with you whose words are only Analytics".The Finale "The New Jerusalem" is prefaced "Without Contraries is no progression", alluding to the use by the composer of a structural device known as <a href="progressive%20tonality">progressive tonality</a>. The movement is structured around the augmented fourth interval between A minor and E-flat major. The text used is the one immortalized by Sir Hubert Parry in his setting of it called "Jerusalem", but in this symphony it is used in a fugal manner, with unaccompanied boys' voices in a fugal exposition heralding the final <a href="peroration">peroration</a>. The composer dedicated this work to his parents, Edward and Stella Strutt, as a mark of respect and recognition for the role they played in providing him with material support for his musical activities.
The score was completed on 1 August 1967 at Park Croft Cottage, Rackwick, on Hoy, Orkney, and the first movement having been completed on 4 June 1966 at Shirva Hut on <a href="Fair%20Isle">Fair Isle</a>, Shetland. The title of the first movement and the Blake quotations (Movements II-VII) were all part of the original conception, but the titles of movements II, V, VI, and VII were added in 1979 after the composer had read <a href="Geoffrey%20Ashe">Geoffrey Ashe</a>'s book on King Arthur's <a href="Camelot">Camelot</a>. The subtitle of the entire work "Visions of <a href="Albion">Albion</a>" was also added at that time.
With the Symphony No. 4, "Kenosis", completed in 1986, Strutt moved right away from tonality as a source of structural method, and the composition consequently exhibits a high degree of <a href="atonality">atonality</a>. This one movement symphony, lasting 20 minutes, features a large array of percussion instruments (marimba, bass marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, <a href="crotales">crotales</a>, tubular bells, Swiss cowbells, tuned gongs, glockenspiel, tamtam, side-drum, suspended cymbol, wood-block, clash cymbols, bass drum, tambourine, wind machine and <a href="g%C3%BCiro">güiro</a>) set in a normal sized orchestra (triple woodwind, etc.). In fact, 78 players are required in all, including four percussionists. The "<a href="Kenosis">Kenosis</a>" subtitle refers to a theological concept which centres on the emptying of the self, such as <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> is considered to have done.
The Symphony No.5 in D major was written before No. 4, but was numbered after it since the composer conceived the fourth first. The dedication is to Edward Winston Watson, and was added to the score on 8 November 1980 as a token of esteem and friendship, and in recognition of his provision of support during the composition of the work, which took place at the Villa Clos Collonges in Territet, Montreux, in Switzerland in 1973. The work is in three movements, and the underlying structural concept is a transition from <a href="serialism">serialism</a> returning to tonality in the finale, this tracing an emotional journey from relative chaos and turmoil into restful tranquility. It is scored for a large orchestra of 99 players and lasts 24 minutes.
Strutt's Symphony No.6 in E-flat minor "Eclogues from a Vanished Land" plays for just 40 minutes and is intended to evoke the lost world of Edwardian rural England, especially the countryside which would have been known to the folk-song collectors, <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="Percy%20Grainger">Percy Grainger</a>. The Vanished land is of course England, but that particular England. The first of the three movements is entitled "ROUNDELAY:'Under the Greenwood Tree...'". Prefaced by the literary quotation "...and this prayer I make, / Knowing that Nature never did betray / The heart that loved her..."(lines 121-123 from Wordworth's "<a href="Tintern%20Abbey">Tintern Abbey</a>"), this movement is obviously from its title intended to evoke the world of <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>. A curious point regarding this first movement is that the conductor, the late Venon Handley, rejected it for performance on the grounds that there was just one bar for the second violin in the first movement which was too difficult to play!
The second movement "TRIPTYCH:'The Mirror of Venus' (after Sir <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>)' is in three sections: (i) ELEGY, (ii) SCHERZO (founded on the English folk tune "Staines Morris"), and (iii) "The Metamorphosis of Narcissus" (after <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>). "Staines Morris" is the only actual folk tune used in the work. The title of the "TRIPTYCH" provides a clue to the structure of the movement, in that Burne-Jones' painting shows a group of Pre-Raphaelite maidens gazing at their own reflections in a pool of water. The three sections form a musical palindrome - the music of the "Metamorphosis of Narcissus" (also a painting showing a youth gazing at his reflection in a pool) is the reverse of the "ELEGY", and hence the "SCHERZO", where the forward-moving music starts to reverse.
The third movement, "FINALE.Three Worlds" (after <a href="M.C.%20Escher">M.C. Escher</a> and with a title also referring to a visual work depicting reflections in water) is also subdivided into three sections: (i) PROLOGUE "A Future IN MEMORIAM"; PERPETUUM MOBILE: and EPILOGUE "In a Country Churchyard" (which is referring to the famous poem by <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a> evoking yet again the idea of "eclogues from a vanished land" which pervades the whole composition).
Symphony No.7 in G minor ("Athonite") lasts for one hour, and is in three movements: I "Pilgrimage", II "Ek Batheon" (the Greek, Έκ βαθέον, meaning "from the depths", or in Latin, "de Profundis") and III FINALE "The Garden of the <a href="Panaghia">Panaghia</a>", referring to the Greek Orthodox monastic idea that the peninsula <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a> (Άγιον Όρος, Agion Oros) forms a garden for the all-holy one, the <a href="Theotokos">Theotokos</a>, or Mother-of-God. Strutt being a member of the society The Friends of Mount Athos (FoMA) has made many visits to Mount Athos, finding it a holy place of inspiration. The symphony was conceived in the early 1990s, but not scored until 2003. "Pilgrimage", the title of the first movement, simply represents the feelings of a visiting pilgrim to the Holy Mountain. "Ek Batheon" however is a much more profound study of the torments of the soul experienced by the solitary hesychast, or hermit, living in utter and total simplicity and wrestling with temptation, arrested by the attempts of the devil to conquer him. In this movement the orchestra is divided into two parts, and the musical events portray a terrifying state of mind. The last movement includes a boys' and men's chorus who sing six of the Orthodox <a href="Apolytikia">Apolytikia</a> of the <a href="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>, and is an attempt to portray the beauty and peace of the Holy Mountain as it appears to an outside visitor.
The Symphony No. 8 ("Orkney Choral Symphony") sees the composer back on home ground - Orkney - where he has lived since 1970. More of a song cycle, the seven movements are settings of Orcadian poetry. The movements are: I-PROLOGUE:"Orkney Summer"(SONNET I), the text by Robert Rendall;II SONG 1: "Cataface" (the <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> for the <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a>), to text by Harriet Campbell; III-LAMENT:"The Brig o' Waithe", the text by <a href="Ann%20Scott-Moncrieff">Ann Scott-Moncrieff</a> describing the civilian casualty in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> Britain when a German aircraft returning to base after attempting to attack <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> randomly released its bombs over <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>; IV-SONG 2 "Sleep! Baby, sleep!", the text by James Morrison; V-INTERMEZZO "Merlin" (SONNET II), the text by <a href="Edwin%20Muir">Edwin Muir</a>; VI-PANEGYRIC "For <a href="Ann%20Scott-Moncrieff">Ann Scott-Moncrieff</a> (1914-43)", the text by <a href="Edwin%20Muir">Edwin Muir</a> and VII-EPILOGUE "The Peace of Orkney", the text by John Skea. The total duration of the composition is just under 25 minutes and the score was completed in 1999.
Strutt's Symphony No. 9 in D minor ("The Fountain of Tears") was completed in 2004. It is a two-part symphonic study of the Spanish poet <a href="Federico%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Lorca">Federico García Lorca</a>. Part I comprises nine settings of his poetry, for soprano and baritone soli, and SATB choir, and orchestra. Part II, entitled "<a href="Ainadamar">Ainadamar</a> (18/ix/1936)", (the name and date of the place where Lorca's execution took place), is purely orchestral and can be considered to be a symphonic poem on the life and death of the poet. In part II the poems set are I "Ballad of the Little Square", II "Hunter", III "Little Balade of the Three Rivers", IV "Song" (to Claudia Gillen), V "Village", VI "Song", VII "Song of the Rider" (1860), VIII "CASIDA of the Rose",and IX "The Lament". This symphony may also be considered a quasi concerto in that there is a prominent part for the acoustic Spanish guitar. The title of the composition, "Fountain of Tears" is the actual meaning of <a href="Ainadamar">Ainadamar</a> (Arabic, "Ayn al-Dam").
The Concert Overture "<a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a>" was created by making a transcription for orchestra of the Rondo for oboe and piano in 1962, the bicentenary year of Cobbett's birth (9 March 1762) at <a href="Farnham">Farnham</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, close to where the composer was born and grew up. Cobbett was a local figure with whose attitudes to life the composer was sympathetic. The overture received a rehearsal performance by the BBC Northern Ireland Light Orchestra in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> in 1969, under the auspices of the BBC's light music rehearsal scheme. The conductor was <a href="Havelock%20Nelson">Havelock Nelson</a> and the producer was Alan Tongue. It was on this occasion that Strutt first met and became acquainted with <a href="Derek%20Bell%20%28musician%29">Derek Bell</a>, the harpist in the orchestra, who became a lifelong friend and exponent of Strutt's works.
In 1973 another transcript was made, for small orchestra, of a single movement originally written for string quartet, under the title "King Richard II". At the head of the score of this concert overture appears a quotation from <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, generally known as <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>'s speech. The quartet dated originally from 1962 and 1966. The orchestral scoring is for double woodwind, two trumpets and two horns, timpani, three percussionists, <a href="celesta">celesta</a> and strings, and the duration is six minutes.
In 1987 a concert overture entitled "<a href="C%C3%A9ilidh">Céilidh</a>" (a <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> word denoting a dance-cum-social gathering) appeared, this also being a transcription but this time from an original piece for clarinet quartet. The work is entirely based on Scottish dance tunes, namely the slow march "John Bain McKenzie's March" (also known as "The Fairy Piper", the <a href="Strathspey%20%28dance%29">Strathspey</a> "Dainty Davie", and the Reels "Maxwell's Rant" and "The Fairy Dance". The scoring is for double wind and brass (without tuba), timpani, percussion and strings, the only exception being that the clarinet section is expanded to four players, and includes bass, alto and piccolo clarinets. The premiere was given on 30 November 1996 (<a href="St.%20Andrew%27s%20Day">St. Andrew's Day</a>) at the Nicolson Square Methodist Church <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> by the New Edinburgh Orchestra under the American conductor Daniel G. Monek, with Lucy Creanor as leader. Another public performance was given on 1 December 1999 at Adelaide's, Bath Street, <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> by the Glasgow Symphony Orchestra conducted by Tommy Fowler.
In 1973, the year before the centenary of the birth of <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, a composer much admired by Strutt, inspired the production of a <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> entitled "Pluto, the Bringer of Change". This was intended as both a tribute to the memory of Holst and a commemoration of his birth, and the intention in performance terms was as a work to be played in the same programme as Holst's "Planets" suite - the orchestration is the same, except that no vocal forces are used. The compositional history of the piece is, however, not of a work originally composed for orchestra, but of a work transcribed for orchestra from a chamber piece for seven clarinets. This clarinet septet - the scoring included the rare octocontrabass and contrabass clarinets, as well as the E-flat piccolo and alto clarinets - was played in a private run-through at Kneller Hall (the <a href="Royal%20Military%20School%20of%20Music">Royal Military School of Music</a>) by an ad hoc ensemble led by Terry Busby in 1969, but subsequently ceased to have a separate existence once the orchestral transcription had been made.
The symphonic poem "At the Tomb of the Sea-Eagles" was composed in 1986. The composer was living in a cottage in the South Parish of <a href="South%20Ronaldsay">South Ronaldsay</a>, and only a couple of fields away from a now prominent archaeological site known as the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Eagles">Tomb of the Eagles</a>. This is a Neolithic chambered tomb discovered in 1958 by Ronald Simison, the farmer on whose land the tomb lies, and later professionally excavated and written-up by John W. Hedges. Hedges occupied a cottage in the locality and became friendly with Strutt. The symphonic poem is dedicated to Hedges, and the score bears a quotation from the latter's popular publication "Tomb of the Eagles": "When in Orkney I sometimes walk down to the tomb of Isbister to spend time on my own. It is a place of great atmosphere where, cut off from the outside world, one is inescapably made aware of the past. I am not talking of psychic phenomena here but, more mundanely, of the sheer impressiveness of a prehistoric monument and the insight which modern archaeology can give us into the period in which it was built. One can almost bring it to life in the imagination and even in its present state of decay it provides considerable reflection. Perhaps one day it will be the source of inspiration for a piece of music - the thought itself is an indication of my feelings".
The work lasts thirteen minutes in performance, and the scoring is for a triple woodwind-sized orchestra including a <a href="cimbalom">cimbalom</a>, piano doubling <a href="celesta">celesta</a>, organ and SATB chorus. The sung text comprises the sacred incantatory mystical syllable "<a href="Om">Om</a>" characteristic of Indian religions, and is used in the context of the score both as a quasi-instrumental element, and a reference to link the practice of <a href="sky%20burial">sky burial</a>, which is believed to have been used at the tomb, with <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> where <a href="excarnation">excarnation</a> is also to be found.
Strutt's String Quartet No. 1 has a long history. Originating in 1959 as a pre-student work, its two movements constituted the only remaining sections of a much longer piece of which the rest was destroyed. The two movements - Lament", and "Scherzo" - were premiered at the Farnham Festival, Surrey, England on 12 May 1960 in <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Parish%20Church%2C%20Farnham">St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham</a>, and were repeated on the next day at the <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> Festival, the performers being Jenifer Springate and Gillian Feltham (violins), Helen Johnstone (viola) and <a href="Dietrich%20K%C3%BCchemann">Dietrich Küchemann</a> (cello). A minor revision of the score was carried out in 2003, followed four years later by a substantial revision which saw the composition expanded to four movements: I "Prologue" (being the original "Lament" of the 1960 version); II ""Variations on J.S.Bach's Chorale Harmonisation of "<a href="Valet%20will%20ich%20dir%20geben">Valet will ich dir geben</a>" by <a href="Melchior%20Teschner">Melchior Teschner</a> (c. 1615)"; III "Scherzo and trio" (substantially as in the original version) and, IV "Epilogue" (a re-working of the material from the first movement).
The String Quartet No. 2 similarly has had a long history of revision. Originally composed in 1963 it was revised in 1991 for submission to the Third "Concurso de Composición Musical ("<a href="Luis%20de%20Narv%C3%A1ez">Luis de Narváez</a>")", in 1992 in Granada, Spain. The work is in four movements: "Prologue"; "Scherzo"; "Adagio" ; "Finale".
The composition of String Quartet No.3 (from ""The Frieze of Life" of <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>)" was prompted by the Oslo Grieg Society's Fourth International <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Edvard Grieg</a> Memorial Competition characterised as "The Music in <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a>'s Paintings". Its three movements are intended to portray musical interpretations of three of Munch's paintings: I "The Dance of Life"; II "<a href="Melancholy">Melancholy</a>"; III "<a href="The%20Scream">The Scream</a>".

Zheleznogorsk () is a <a href="closed%20city">closed</a> <a href="types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia">town</a> in <a href="Krasnoyarsk%20Krai">Krasnoyarsk Krai</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, with a developed nuclear industry. Population: 
The town was formerly known as Krasnoyarsk-26 ().
It was established in 1950 for the production of weapons-grade plutonium. The history of the town and the associated defense complex are intertwined. In 1959, the Government created the Eastern office of <a href="S.P.%20Korolev%20Rocket%20and%20Space%20Corporation%20Energia">OKB-1</a> (further <a href="NPO%20PM">NPO PM</a>) under M.F. Reshetnev supervision. Defense plants included nuclear facilities built within caverns excavated in the granite mountain on the northern edge of the city as well as space research enterprises.
It was a secret town in the Soviet Union until President <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> decreed in 1992 that such places could use their historical names. Before then, the town had not appeared on any official maps. As is the tradition with Soviet towns containing secret facilities, "Krasnoyarsk-26" is actually a P.O. Box number and implies that the place is located some distance from the city of Krasnoyarsk. The town was also known as "Soctown", "Iron City", the "Nine", and "Atom Town".
Within the <a href="subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Administrative%20divisions">framework of administrative divisions</a>, it is, together with five <a href="types%20of%20inhabited%20localities%20in%20Russia">rural localities</a>, incorporated as the <a href="city%20of%20federal%20subject%20significance">closed administrative-territorial formation</a> of Zheleznogorsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the <a href="administrative%20divisions%20of%20Krasnoyarsk%20Krai">districts</a>. As a <a href="subdivisions%20of%20Russia%23Municipal%20divisions">municipal division</a>, the closed administrative-territorial formation of Zheleznogorsk is incorporated as Zheleznogorsk Urban Okrug.
Zheleznogorsk is the location of the Krasnoyarsk <a href="Mining%20and%20Chemical%20Combine">Mining and Chemical Combine</a>, a combine which played a significant role in the early Russian nuclear weapons production campaigns.
Zheleznogorsk is also the location for the production of plutonium, electricity and district heat using graphite-moderated water-cooled reactors. The last reactor was shut down permanently in Аpril 2010. It is the location of a military reprocessing facility and for a Russian commercial nuclear-waste storage facility.
A significant employer in the city is <a href="JSC%20Information%20Satellite%20Systems">JSC Information Satellite Systems</a>, Russia's largest satellite manufacturer and the prime developer of the <a href="GLONASS">GLONASS</a> program.

Cirta

Cirta (from <a href="Berber%20language">Berber</a>: KRTN or Kirthan, ) was the capital city of the <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> Kingdom of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> in northern Africa (modern <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>). Its strategically important port city was <a href="Russicada">Russicada</a>. Although Numidia was a key ally of the ancient <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> during the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a> (264 BC–146 BC), Cirta was subject to Roman invasions during the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. Eventually went under Roman dominion during the rule of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>. Cirta was then repopulated by Italian colonists by Caesar and <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> and was surrounded by a "Confederation of free Roman cities" (<a href="Tiddis">Tiddis</a>, <a href="Cuicul">Cuicul</a>, <a href="Milevum">Milevum</a>, etc.) The city was destroyed in the beginning of the 4th century and was rebuilt by the Roman Emperor <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, who gave his name to the newly constructed city, <a href="Constantine%2C%20Algeria">Constantine</a>. <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> damaged Cirta, but emperor <a href="Justinianus%20I">Justinianus I</a> reconquered and improved the roman city. Arabs finally destroyed it in 698 AD, reducing the former Christian city to a small Moslem village that only after some centuries recovered some importance.
Cirta was an important <a href="Roman%20%27Coloniae%27%20in%20Berber%20Africa">roman colonia in Berber Africa</a> characterized by a full <a href="romanitas">latinisation</a> during the late <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>: it was fully <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> speaking and <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> when the Vandals arrived in 430 AD, according to historian <a href="Theodore%20Mommsen">Theodore Mommsen</a>. Pliny calls the city as the first century roman colonia "Cirta Sittianorum", together with <a href="Rusicade">Rusicade</a>, <a href="Milevum">Milevum</a> and <a href="Chullu%20%28Roman%20city%29">Chullu</a> in what was an autonomous territory of the new province <a href="Africa%20Nova">Africa Nova</a>.
Indeed, Rome allowed <a href="Publius%20Sittius">Publius Sittius</a> and his Italian legionaries from <a href="Campania">Campania</a> to rule the territory of Cirta and surroundings with the Latin name of "Respublica IIII coloniarum Cirtensium". Later, with the expansion of the Roman limes, Cirta was at the center of the most romanised area in Roman Africa (protected by the <a href="Fossatum%20Africae">Fossatum Africae</a> stretching from <a href="Sitifis">Sitifis</a> and <a href="Icosium">Icosium</a> (modern Algiers) to <a href="Capsa">Capsa</a> and the modern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Gab%C3%A8s">Gulf of Gabès</a>.
However under Publius Sittius Cirta was a special colony with some autonomy from Rome, but under emperor Augustus the city obtained full roman status as colonia with the name "Iulia Iuvenalis Honoris et Virtutis Cirta" in 27 BC. Since then Cirta started to grow enormously as an economic center of Roman Africa.
The city by the end of the second century -when Christianity started to be important- had nearly 50,000 inhabitants, according to historian Robin Daniel.
Cirta's populace was as diverse as the Roman Republic itself — alongside native Numidians were <a href="Carthage">Carthaginians</a> displaced by the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second</a> and <a href="Third%20Punic%20War">Third Punic War</a>s, as well as Greeks, Romans, and Italians. It served as an economic hub for Rome’s African empire, as it was inhabited by Roman and Italian merchants, bankers, and businessmen. Even prior to Cirta’s fall to Julius Caesar, these economic elites constituted an important segment of the city's population, as they kept it within Rome’s sphere of influence without having to be directly controlled.
Not only was Cirta an important economic site, it was also a key political and military spot within the African kingdoms. During the Second Punic War, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cirta">Battle of Cirta</a> (203 BC) marked a decisive Roman victory for <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a> against Rome's most formidable rival in the Mediterranean — Carthage. Moreover, Rome illustrated its willingness to defend its interests in Cirta into the late 2nd century BC following the death of <a href="Micipsa">Micipsa</a>, King of Numidia, in 118 BC. A power struggle ensued between his adopted son <a href="Jugurtha">Jugurtha</a> and his natural son <a href="Adherbal%20%28king%20of%20Numidia%29">Adherbal</a>. Adherbal appealed to Rome to help broker a truce and to help evenly split the kingdom between the two heirs. Despite a senatorial commission’s seemingly successful mediation, Jugurtha besieged Cirta, killing Adherbal and Italian elites who defended him. Subsequently, Rome declared war on the kingdom to assert its hegemony in the region and to defend those citizens who lived outside of the homeland. Jugurtha’s defeat at Cirta at the hands of the Roman army is commonly referred to as the <a href="Jugurthine%20War">Jugurthine War</a>.
Caesar's conquest of Northern Africa officially brought Cirta under direct Roman rule in 46 BC. It was during the rule of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, however, when Cirta's territory expanded and assimilated into the empire. Augustus split Cirta into communities, or "pagis", dividing Numidians and newly settled Romans. In 26 BC, the emperor attempted to increase Roman settlement in the city by supplementing the Sittiani — followers of <a href="Publius%20Sittius">Sittius Nucerinus</a>, a man from Italian <a href="Nocera%20Inferiore">Nucera</a> whom Julius Caesar had personally appointed to "Romanize" the city. This helped facilitate Cirta's assumption into the Roman realm, culturally and economically. These settlers, of course, were augmenting those Romans who had inhabited the city since the earlier periods of the Punic Wars, namely the Italian business elite.
In the first two centuries AD <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> began to take root in Cirta. While little remains of African Christianity before 200 AD, records of martyred Christians at Cirta existed by mid-century. Civil war in 311 marked the destruction of the city; however, the first Christian emperor Constantine rebuilt it in his own name in 313 AD, calling it Constantine.
Cirta was renamed by <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a>: "Civitas Constantina Cirtensium". It was surrounded by a "Confederation of free Roman cities" (<a href="Tiddis">Tiddis</a>, <a href="Cuicul">Cuicul</a>, etc.), that in the fourth century was dismantled. In 412 AD in Cirta was done an important Christian Council, ruled by Saint Augustine. Under the emperor <a href="Justinianus%20I">Justinianus I</a> the city walls were reinforced and the city was named capital of the region with a Byzantine "Dux" resident. Cirta was part of the Byzantine <a href="Exarchate%20of%20Africa">Exarchate of Africa</a> from 534 AD to 697 AD. It was conquered by the Arabs in the 7th century, receiving later the name of "Qusantina".
When the Arabs conquered the region, <a href="Christian%20Berbers">berber</a> queen <a href="Kahina">Kahina</a> fought in the city, that was partially destroyed. Since then Cirta -now called "Constantina"- lost importance, but remained inhabited: for a couple of centuries and until the tenth century there was even a small Christian community.

He died in Paris in 1899.
Among the best of his works are "<a href="Gaspard%20Hauser">Gaspard Hauser</a>" (1838) with <a href="Anicet%20Bourgeois">Anicet Bourgeois</a>; "Les Bohémiens de Paris" (1842) with <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Grange">Eugène Grange</a>; with <a href="Mallian">Mallian</a>, "Marie-Jeanne, ou la femme du peuple" (1845), in which <a href="Madame%20Dorval">Madame Dorval</a> obtained a great success; "La Case d'Oncle Tom" (1853); and "Les Deux Orphelines" (1875), perhaps his best piece, with <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Cormon">Eugène Cormon</a>.

NBC, Inc. v. United States

National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, <a href="Case%20citation">319 U.S. 190</a> (1943), was a case in which the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> held on May 10, 1943 that the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> had the power to issue regulations pertaining to associations between broadcasting networks and their affiliated stations, otherwise known as "chain networks." The case is important in the development of <a href="American%20administrative%20law">American administrative law</a>.
The scope of authority held by an agency is determined by the agency's <a href="organic%20statute%20%28USA%29">organic statute</a>. Where Congress grants an agency the power to maintain and regulate an area guided by the "public interest, convenience, or necessity," such a grant of power can include the regulation of areas not explicitly contemplated by the organic statute, as long as they are within the scope of the purpose of the original statute.
Note: The approach in this case takes a much more expansive approach than the earlier case of "<a href="ICC%20v.%20Cincinnati%2C%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Texas%20Pacific%20Railway%20Co.">ICC v. Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway Co.</a>" which provided for more limited powers for administrative agencies. Specifically, "ICC" held that regulative powers must be expressly granted by statute and not implied, while "NBC" held that the issuance of regulations, though not expressly granted, are an acceptable way for the agency to fulfill its statutory obligations to serve the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."
The FCC established <a href="Chain%20Broadcasting%20Regulations">Chain Broadcasting Regulations</a> in 1941, which specifically governed the licensing and content of chain broadcasting stations. <a href="NBC">NBC</a> sued to enjoin the enforcement of the regulations. The <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> dismissed the complaint, ruling for the government, and NBC appealed.
The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, ruling that the government had the power to enact and enforce the regulations in question.
The FCC's authority stemmed from its organic statute, the <a href="Communications%20Act%20of%201934">Communications Act of 1934</a>. The Act provided that:
The Act also provided that the criterion governing the exercise of the Commission's license power is the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."
NBC argued that the FCC's power was limited to the technical aspects of radio transmission. The Court found that it was not, but instead "we are asked to regard the Commission as a kind of traffic officer, policing the wave lengths to prevent stations from interfering with each other."
NBC argued that the Act did not explicitly allow the Commission to develop regulations for chain broadcasting. The Court admitted this, but held that an explicit grant of power was not necessary in this context, because the field was new and dynamic, and that by granting power to the FCC, it intended "not niggardly but expansive powers."
NBC argued that the grant of power to the FCC was unconstitutionally vague, because it did not provide definite guidelines. The Court found that the guidelines were the service of "public interest, convenience, or necessity," and that those guidelines were constitutionally sufficient.
The Court concluded that the Chain Broadcasting Regulations were simply the particularization of the Commission's conception of the "public interest" sought to be safeguarded by Congress in enacting the Communications Act.
The Opinion of the Supreme Court was not unanimous and it led to a conflict with an earlier decision in "Federal Communications Commission v. Sanders Brothers Radio Station. 309 U.S. 470" on March 25, 1940.
In "Sanders Brothers", the FCC interpreted Supreme Court decisions concerning broadcasting to mean that potential economic injury to an existing licensee was not grounds for refusing to license a competitor. (This FCC interpretation remained in place from 1940 to 1958.)
The Opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a> with Justices <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a> and Rutledge taking no part in the discussion or decision. Justice Murphy offered a dissenting Opinion by stating that the Court was effectively giving the FCC a power to regulate networks which had not been given to the FCC by Congress. Murphy stated that;
"... we exceed our competence when we gratuitously bestow upon an agency power which the Congress has not granted. Since that is what the Court in substance does today, I dissent."
The decision effectively gave the FCC power to regulate the networks. As a result of this 1943 decision, NBC was forced to sell one of its networks and it was this action which then led to the creation of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC).

Gary Stevens (footballer, born 1962)

Gary Andrew Stevens (born 30 March 1962) is an English former <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> who played in <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> for <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a>, <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. He won seven <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>.
Stevens was born in <a href="Hillingdon">Hillingdon</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, and attended Thurston Upper School in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>. He joined <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton &amp; Hove Albion</a> in 1977. Stevens made his debut as a 17-year-old on 15 September 1979, in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> as Brighton won 2–0 at home to <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, the club which had released him as a schoolboy. A versatile <a href="defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a> who could also play in <a href="midfielder">midfield</a>, he made 26 appearances in his first season, scoring once, and remained a regular in the side.
In 1983, Brighton, already <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> to the Second Division, played in the <a href="1983%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> for the first time in their history. Losing to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 2–1 with three minutes of normal time remaining, Stevens equalised, and teammate <a href="Gordon%20Smith%20%28footballer%20born%20December%201954%29">Gordon Smith</a> missed an easy chance to win the game at the end of extra time, remembered for the commentator's line "And Smith must score..." Brighton lost the replay 4–0, and Stevens joined <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for a fee of "about £350,000".
Stevens made his Tottenham debut at the start of the <a href="1983-84%20in%20English%20football">1983-84 season</a>, again against Ipswich, but this time was on the losing side. He was a first team regular that season, making 40 league appearances and scoring four goals, and played on the winning side in the <a href="1984%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">1984 UEFA Cup Final</a>, scoring his <a href="penalty%20kick">penalty</a> in the <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">shootout</a> against <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>. He was also in the side that suffered an unlikely 3-2 defeat to <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> in the <a href="1987%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1987 FA Cup Final</a>.
He was also <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">capped</a> seven times by <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>, and was included in the squad for the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a> squad – as, confusingly, was the unrelated <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> player <a href="Gary%20M.%20Stevens">Gary Stevens</a>. He later joked that Sir Bobby Robson picked them both to make sure he got the right one. He made two <a href="substitute%20%28association%20football%29">substitute</a> appearances in the tournament. He also won eight caps for <a href="England%20under-21%20national%20football%20team">England under-21s</a>.
Stevens left Spurs for <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in 1990 but persistent injuries forced him to retire in 1992. He had never fully recovered from a knee injury suffered in November 1988 when heavily tackled by <a href="Vinnie%20Jones">Vinnie Jones</a>. At the time of the challenge, Gary Stevens was contesting possession of the ball with <a href="John%20Fashanu">John Fashanu</a> near the touchline when Jones slid into him.
Following retirement he worked as a presenter for <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>, and for <a href="Talksport">Talksport</a> radio in the UK, although he has since left the station.
Gary also became Manager of Wessex league side <a href="Petersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Petersfield Town</a> in 1992-3 season but resigned 6 months later.
At the start of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Azerbaijan%20Premier%20League">2010–11 Azerbaijan Premier League</a>, Stevens joined <a href="Gabala%20FC">Gabala</a> as assistant to <a href="Tony%20Adams%20%28footballer%29">Tony Adams</a>. Stevens stayed on as assistant after Adams left in November 2011, until April 2012 when he also left the club.
In January 2013 he became the assistant coach at <a href="Sligo%20Rovers">Sligo Rovers</a>.

TheFutureEmbrace

TheFutureEmbrace is the only solo album by <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a>, frontman of the <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>. Released in June 2005, the album's sound was markedly different from most of Corgan's earlier work, eschewing his characteristic "drums, bass, (and) big-guitars sound" in favor of an <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> sound punctuated with heavily distorted guitar parts reminiscent of <a href="shoegazing">shoegazing</a>. On the day of the album's release, Corgan said it "picks up the thread of the as-yet-unfinished work and charter of The Smashing Pumpkins" and announced plans to reform that band. He has released all of his music under the Smashing Pumpkins banner since 2006.
After the dissolution of <a href="Zwan">Zwan</a> in late 2003, Corgan set to work on a solo album of songs based on the history of his hometown, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. This project was shelved and Corgan began work on "TheFutureEmbrace" in late 2004 in his Chicago studio, Pumpkinland. Rather than repeat the sonic territory of his earlier bands, Corgan decided on an electronic sound with shoegaze influences. Regarding the atypical sound of the album, Corgan remarked,
The sound of the album is almost entirely synthesized, with the exception of Corgan's voice and guitar playing. Corgan has an extensive collection of vintage <a href="analog%20synthesizer">analog synthesizer</a>s and <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>s that were employed on the album. The synths were largely programmed by <a href="Bon%20Harris">Bon Harris</a> of <a href="Nitzer%20Ebb">Nitzer Ebb</a>. Arrangements on the album followed an unusual process - for each song, Corgan would write the basic structure, and the song's melody was then split into four sections based on the <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a>, <a href="tenor">tenor</a>, <a href="alto">alto</a>, and <a href="soprano">soprano</a> voicings of the chord structure. The production team - Corgan, Harris, producer <a href="Bjorn%20Thorsrud">Bjorn Thorsrud</a>, and programmers <a href="Matt%20Walker%20%28drummer%29">Matt Walker</a> and <a href="Brian%20Liesegang">Brian Liesegang</a> - would then program different synth melodies in each voicing, and combine them into a multitrack recording. Drums were added, mostly from pre-1985 drum machines. At this point, Corgan would rework vocal parts and record vocals, as well as recording his guitar part. Each song contains a single take of guitar, in stark contrast to the <a href="Boston%20%28band%29">Boston</a>-style multitracking employed on Smashing Pumpkins albums. Despite the challenge of this approach, it was employed for all album tracks as well as an additional 8 outtakes.
The album features backing vocals and a guitar solo by <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a> frontman <a href="Robert%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a> on a cover of the <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a>' song "<a href="To%20Love%20Somebody%20%28song%29">To Love Somebody</a>", while "DIA" features electronic drums played by Corgan's longtime collaborator, drummer <a href="Jimmy%20Chamberlin">Jimmy Chamberlin</a>, as well as the violin and backing voice of <a href="Emilie%20Autumn">Emilie Autumn</a>.
In the lead-up to the album, Corgan generated considerable attention when he started publishing an autobiography, <a href="http%3A//billycorgan.livejournal.com/tag/confessions">"The Confessions of Billy Corgan"</a>, on his website, piece-by-piece. The postings are notable for Corgan's candor regarding his family, personal relationships, and activity during different eras of The Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan updated the Confessions on a frequent basis, but after posting an entry titled "Following the Moon (1974)" on July 1, 2005, the entries stopped.
The album was preceded by the release of a single and music video release of "<a href="Walking%20Shade">Walking Shade</a>". Corgan, with his touring band, performed "Mina Loy (M.O.H.)" on "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>" the day before the album's release. Corgan also appeared on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>", and played "To Love Somebody."
Those who pre-ordered the album from the iTunes store received a bonus track from the TheFutureEmbrace recording sessions, "Tilt." "Tilt" was also included on the Target retail stores exclusive release, "Red Room Vol. 4".
Billy Corgan, with Matt Walker, Brian Liesegang, and <a href="Linda%20Strawberry">Linda Strawberry</a>, embarked on an international club tour in support of the album in the summer of 2005.
"TheFutureEmbrace"'s critical reception was mixed. <a href="Jim%20DeRogatis">Jim DeRogatis</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" said the album represented Corgan's "most distinctive and consistent music." Performing well below Smashing Pumpkins releases, it charted at #89 in the UK and peaked at #31 in the United States. As of February 2006, the album's domestic sales were a mere 69,000 units sold.
